Without further ado, let me pass it on to Mr. Dua and team. Over to you, sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 4, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO)', 'text': \"Thank you, Sameer. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 and H1 FY25 earnings call to discuss the financial and operational performance of the company. We have already uploaded the earnings press release and the investor presentation on the stock exchange as well as on our website. And we hope that you have had an opportunity to go through them. Before we begin the question and answer session, let me quickly go through some of the highlights of Q2 and H1 FY25 performance, beginning with Q2. Revenue from operations in Q2 FY25 was at INR 679 crores as compared to INR 715 crores in Q2 FY24, a decline of 5% year-on-year. This is mainly due to weak market demand during the quarter. Our EBITDA for the quarter was at INR 88 crores as compared to INR 92 crores in the corresponding quarter in the previous year. The company maintained its EBITDA margin at 12.9% during the quarter as compared to 12.8% in Q2 FY24, despite the subdued demand. PAT was at INR 37 crores as compared to INR 44 crores reported in Q2 FY24. PAT margin for Q2 FY25 stood at 5.4% as compared to 6.2% in Q2 FY24. Higher depreciation in the quarter has impacted the profitability of the company. Now moving to our H1 FY25 performance. In H1 FY25, we recorded a revenue of INR 1,428 crores, EBITDA was at INR 187 crores compared to INR 199 crores in the same period of last year. EBITDA margin was at 13.1% as compared to 13.7% in H1 FY24. PAT for H1 FY25 stood at INR 81 crores against INR 101 crores in H1 FY24. PAT margin was at 5.7% as compared to 6.9% in H1 FY24. The company has incurred a capex of INR 49 crores till 30th September '24. Our company continues to be net debt free and supported by positive cash flow from operations. Our company is in process of adding new distributors and focusing on to improve retail network through various initiatives. Further in line with our continued focus on cost efficiencies, we are performance in the future. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.\"}, {'chunk_id': 5, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question is from the line of Videesha Sheth from Ambit Capital.'}, {'chunk_id': 6, 'speaker': 'Videesha Sheth', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'My first question was on the commentary that you made in the press release regarding consumers down-trading to lower price on organized competition and your call to not dilute prices. So how do you see that impacting volumes and market share in the near term?'}, {'chunk_id': 7, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Hi. This is Gaurav. We are seeing a pretty poor footfall happening across the country what we have noticed. And there is a mushrooming of local players, the unorganized players, new and new unorganized players have also come into the play. So there was a pressure on us to reduce the prices which we have not. And we are in process of adding more retailers and distributors to counter that.'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'Videesha Sheth', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So Gaurav, where I'm coming from is that during FY23 also when we faced a lot of pressure from RM inflation. We chose to increase prices, but we also then lost market share due to that. So do you see this call of not diluting or reducing prices affecting volumes as well or impacting our market share in that way?\"}, {'chunk_id': 9, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"Temporarily, we can say, yes. But in long term, I think we will be able to gain back the market share. It's because of 2 factors. There is poor footfalls, demand is also subdued and the raw material prices, all these things, because of multiple factors, they were able to enter. But I think now the wedding season, we are hearing like quarter 3, a lot of weddings are happening, there will be a demand uptake in the market and things will improve.\"}, {'chunk_id': 10, 'speaker': 'Videesha Sheth', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it. And the second question was if you can share your observations on the channel inventory and some granular sense on consumption trends as well, while there is overall weakness, but if you could break it down into how we are seeing the move in rural versus urban and also the competitive landscape?'}, {'chunk_id': 11, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Channel inventory, we are maintaining, there is an increase in the inventory as compared to March. So it has increased due to subdued demand. And inventory, we are carrying almost in GT and new channel at the same level, but retail, it has increased a little bit. So overall, there is an increase on inventory front.'}, {'chunk_id': 12, 'speaker': 'Videesha Sheth', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it. And my last question is what would be your outlook for margins versus the earlier guidance of 15% to 16% for FY25?'}, {'chunk_id': 13, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'I think company is taking a lot of steps to improve the margins. On the back-end front, we are working very closely with the manufacturing how to really improve our productivity and add on to our margins.'}, {'chunk_id': 14, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'The next question is from the line of Shirish Pardeshi from Centrum Broking. about 6% to INR 156 and the number of pair sold is lower. So I do understand there is a demand issue and other things. But is there any regional variation because we have a larger business coming from North. Is the difference between North and South and West and East is different in terms of this demand situation?'}, {'chunk_id': 15, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'See, across India, we are seeing this issue of demand not being optimum. But East, if you talk about, East is most affected. So payments are very slow coming from Eastern markets. So East is the market which has been mostly affected.'}, {'chunk_id': 16, 'speaker': 'Shirish Pardeshi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. So we have been saying that we are trying to, in fact, improve the mix towards the premium end also. Any color, any mix you would be able to highlight at this point of time?'}, {'chunk_id': 17, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Status quo. Our prices were more because we revised the prices in January. This is the effect of higher ASP.'}, {'chunk_id': 18, 'speaker': 'Shirish Pardeshi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. Okay. And in terms of Sparx contribution, would you specify how we should look at in second half? Because you said that you are focusing on the distribution angle also.'}, {'chunk_id': 19, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sparx, I think we are able to maintain the momentum in Sparx compared to the other open footwear. So I think Sparx should definitely be better off compared to other 2 brands, that is Flite and Bahamas.'}, {'chunk_id': 20, 'speaker': 'Shirish Pardeshi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. So I assume that the first half, the situation demand down trading, regional competition, local competition, if the status quo is there, how we should be looking at second half? Because even second half was -- the base is benign at this point of time. But does last 30, 40 days give you some confidence that we will be able to recoup our volume growth?'}, {'chunk_id': 21, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Currently, like in October or whatever, you can see the start, we have not seen a great start. So we are hoping that because of this November-December having a huge number of weddings, so demand should improve.'}, {'chunk_id': 22, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'The next question is from the line of Prerna Jhunjhunwala from Elara Capital.'}, {'chunk_id': 23, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Just wanted to check on closed footwear performance now that we've added capacity in last year. So has the mix change taken place in the first half and second quarter?\"}, {'chunk_id': 24, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So it's same like what it was the last year and last quarter. There's not much of a change happening there.\"}, {'chunk_id': 25, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So what is your strategy to improve our mix towards closed footwear?'}, {'chunk_id': 26, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': \"Strategy we talked about, again, it is like appointment of distributor, adding more channels, for example, e-commerce. We were a little slow this time because of too much of ask from Flipkart and Amazon. So we are very cautious and then we are taking steps to improve our reach in Sparx. conservative demand is also weak and you're expecting improvement in demand coming forward in the quarters to come. So how should we see the growth coming in for you?\"}, {'chunk_id': 27, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So we are really cautious of the market. And what we see is we have to grow, like we are appointing more distributors across territories. And we are hoping that we can grow around 8% to 10% in Sparx category.'}, {'chunk_id': 28, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Okay. And overall revenue growth that you're targeting?\"}, {'chunk_id': 29, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Difficult to say as of now, but definitely it should be positive.'}, {'chunk_id': 30, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. And what would be the distributor and retail reach increase for you in the next 2 years for both open footwear and closed footwear?'}, {'chunk_id': 31, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"See it's a continuous process. We keep on adding distributors. So it is a continuous process. So adding retailers, like if you see 2 years back, we were at 55,000. Now we are at 70,000 retailers. So, it's a continuous activity, continuous process.\"}, {'chunk_id': 32, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'We can assume the same run rate to continue?'}, {'chunk_id': 33, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, definitely.'}, {'chunk_id': 34, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'The next question is from the line of Sameer Gupta from IIFL Securities.'}, {'chunk_id': 35, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"I noticed that there is an ASP increase of 6%. I mean, I heard that you mentioned that you've taken a revision of price in January, but even from last quarter onwards, this is an increase of around 3%. So just wanted to understand is there a change in mix that is impacting this and some more color on this?\"}, {'chunk_id': 36, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'See, we have introduced premium categories in some of our brands. And because of that, there is an effect of increase in ASP, plus we have taken a price increase in the January in Hawaii category. And last year, the base level was also a little lower.'}, {'chunk_id': 37, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. But there is no price increase as such taken in this quarter?'}, {'chunk_id': 38, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'No, no, we have not taken price increase.'}, {'chunk_id': 39, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Got it, sir. Sir, second question on this competitive intensity increasing. What is the trigger for this? Has there been a sharp fall in raw material prices that has resulted in this intensity going up? And how is the company going to counter it? I mean, let's say, it continues for a few more quarters. So do you have a strategy in place to counter it at some point? Or do you keep waiting because it's unsustainable and it will go away at some point in time?\"}, {'chunk_id': 40, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"So you're absolutely right because of lower raw material prices, a lot of new competitors have come in. We are working with our marketing team to devise a new portfolio, a new portfolio strategy, so how to counter them. So we are working on cost optimization plus adding new is happening.\"}, {'chunk_id': 41, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"And is there a role of the BIS compliance also in this that the smaller players don't have to comply as of now? Is that also impacting?\"}, {'chunk_id': 42, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes, that could be a reason because all small manufacturers, they are exempt from Quality Control standards. So whatever quality they want to produce, they can downgrade and they can cause unethical competition also otherwise. So that also has some role.'}, {'chunk_id': 43, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Got it, sir. Lastly, sir, if I may squeeze in. The other expenses have seen a decline of 3%. Just wanted to understand the broad constituents, which is resulting in this. And also, let's say, the volume growth comes back, do you see this growth in other expenses also coming back? Or this INR 220 crores number odd is the ballpark, which is here to stay?\"}, {'chunk_id': 44, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Other expenses, we took a very calculated call. We have just reduced the advertisement expenses in this period as compared to last year. So that is the major item, which has come down.'}, {'chunk_id': 45, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'But do you see this going up going forward if demand comes back?'}, {'chunk_id': 46, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes. Next year, definitely. Not this year. Next year, definitely, we will review, and we may go back to the original percentage spend.'}, {'chunk_id': 47, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So FY25, what is the number that you're targeting for ad spend, full year?\"}, {'chunk_id': 48, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Generally, we used to spend around 4%. So this year, we have just thought about 3%, 1% lower than last year.'}, {'chunk_id': 49, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'The next question is from the line of Gaurav Jogani from JM Financial.'}, {'chunk_id': 50, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Apologies for the earlier, sir. And my question is with regards to the impact of BIS. I mean, while in the shorter term because these smaller players are given a relaxation of not complying with the norms. But on longer term, how do you see the norms impacting the industry on an overall basis and Relaxo specifically?'}, {'chunk_id': 51, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"Government has actually given exemption to the small industry for the time being. It doesn't mean they're going to go on always. That we have to wait and see how they see. But as far as we are concerned, we are strictly following quality control standard prescribed by Bureau of the Indian Standards.\"}, {'chunk_id': 52, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes. So because you guys are following the quality standards prescribed by the agency, then can you be marketing your products as a better quality product and hence, they do ISI or BSI mark. So can there be marketing angle that benefit guys at the value end who are following these norms? Is there a case for that?'}, {'chunk_id': 53, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No, no, on the long term, this will benefit the company. In the short term because of there's a market down trading, people are not having enough money in their hands, so they are going for the quality products that we are following.\"}, {'chunk_id': 54, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'The next question is from the line of Prerna Jhunjhunwala from Elara Capital.'}, {'chunk_id': 55, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"I wanted to understand the capex for the year. What will be the full capex for FY '25 and '26?\"}, {'chunk_id': 56, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official (CFO)', 'text': 'FY25, already we have spent around INR 50 crores. So, it will be again in the range of INR 50 crores to INR 60 crores in next half. So, total will be INR 100 crores plus in this full year.'}, {'chunk_id': 57, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And what is it going to be spent on, INR 100 crores?'}, {'chunk_id': 58, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"This majorly we have spent upon the regular items, which we spent around INR 25 crores to INR 30 crores. Then we are adding some machineries and some civil work also. So it's a mix of all these.\"}, {'chunk_id': 59, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. Okay. Can we assume any capacity addition in this?'}, {'chunk_id': 60, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'No.'}, {'chunk_id': 61, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'The next question is from the line of Ankit Kedia from PhillipCapital.'}, {'chunk_id': 62, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Sir, when you say October has been a slow month for you and you're hopeful for November, already primary sales for November would have been done now, and you would be generating demand for the next month. So are we seeing pressures in primary demand from distributors and they're sitting on high stock? And if you could answer separately for open footwear and closed footwear?\"}, {'chunk_id': 63, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"So it is same for both open and closed footwear. Still, we are hoping that next 2 months should be better compared to what has happened last quarter. So because of poor footfalls, these things are happening. So it would be gradual. It cannot be just immediate the things will change. Ankit Kedia And sir, are we facing pressure from organized players as well like Walkaroo and Aqualite who have also become aggressive in the open footwear category? Or it's not from the unorganized only what you called out?\"}, {'chunk_id': 64, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"They are also facing challenges from unorganized. I think, they are also facing a lot of issues compared to BIS of unorganized players, lower footfalls. For full industry, it is the same. Ankit Kedia And sir, 3 quarters back, last year when we had lost market share, you alluded that you go for market share gains and not for margins. And now again, as a strategy, you're going for margins and not for market share gains. So what is the long-term thought process of the company on top line growth versus margins?\"}, {'chunk_id': 65, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No, we're taking a balanced approach. It cannot be one way. It cannot be only margin or only sales. We have to take a long-term view and take a balanced approach. brand as well.\"}, {'chunk_id': 66, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'No. On the long term, we have to see the thing. Our strategy has to be not based on what currently we are going through. We have to make quality product, and we have to sustain the things. We are adding distributors. We are adding retailers. We have introduced a retail app, our connect with the retailer is improving. And this base is improving of our retailers. Our reach improves, definitely, the sale will also improve.'}, {'chunk_id': 67, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, can you separately call out the growth in the North market versus the West and South, if possible?'}, {'chunk_id': 68, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Can you repeat it please? Ankit Kedia Can you just let call out the revenue growth or the volume decline in North versus ex. North region?'}, {'chunk_id': 69, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'There has been just a marginal 1% drop in some areas sustained in the West and South. So basically East, we have seen a little more dip compared to other regions.'}, {'chunk_id': 70, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'The next question is from the line of Aditya Khetan from SMIFS Institutional Equities.'}, {'chunk_id': 71, 'speaker': 'Aditya Khetan', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes. Sir, my first question is on to the volumes part. Sir, in H1, we had seen that the volumes have declined by almost around 5% as compared to the last year of H1. And sir, you have also stated that the muted demand and all, and you are hopeful for a good wedding season. Sir, so any guidance on to the full year volume side, if you can share, so whether we can see a positive growth or it would be flattish?'}, {'chunk_id': 72, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'It would be flattish because it will take time to cover up the 6-month sales and volume loss.'}, {'chunk_id': 73, 'speaker': 'Aditya Khetan', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. Okay. And sir, despite facing this muted demand, sir, so when we look at the operational metrics, like your gross profit per pair and EBITDA per pair. So that has gone up on a sequential basis by around so 3% to 4%. I wanted to know, is there any component of the better product mix which we have seen in this quarter?.'}, {'chunk_id': 74, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"EBITDA is by and large same in the first quarter, second quarter if you compare to last year's first quarter and second quarter, total H1, H2, just a 0.5% difference of EBITDA.\"}, {'chunk_id': 75, 'speaker': 'Aditya Khetan', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it. On the gross profit, sir, we have seen a good improvement. Any comments over there?'}, {'chunk_id': 76, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"Growth, definitely, there are 3 reasons for this. We took a price increase in January, so that is the advantage has come in the system. Raw materials has also, I think, eased out. And third is, if you see the percentage, there is an increase of inventory, so that percentage is, I think, 1% looks better than the last year. So these are the 3 reasons. So one is the price increase; second, raw material advantage; third, that is the accounting part. You can see there is an increase of inventory of around INR 47 crores in this, that includes a conversion cost also. That's why that margin looks better.\"}, {'chunk_id': 77, 'speaker': 'Jasmine', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'I wanted to understand your comment on reduction of the A&P cost. My understanding is that the demand is muted, the local players are kicking in. So what is the rationale of reducing our A&P spend when this time, I believe there should be more spend to garner more market share and hence increase the volume and sales?'}, {'chunk_id': 78, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So what we have done is we have reduced in advertisement but increased on schemes in sales and promotion. So because of trade, push is required for an immediate scenario, so we have increased our schemes expenditure.'}, {'chunk_id': 79, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'The next question is from the line of Sachee Trivedi from Trident Capital.'}, {'chunk_id': 80, 'speaker': 'Sachee Trivedi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. Great. This is Sachee Trivedi from Trident Capital Investments. My question is slightly more longer-term oriented. Now in the last 2, 3 years, we have seen 2 things happening: one is the shift of demand from open to closed footwear. And the second is a shift of demand from probably the physical channels to online channels. How did you not see this coming?'}, {'chunk_id': 81, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"There were multiple factors. Like, for example, nobody saw that there will be such poor footfalls, leading to poor payments from the retailers. So it's very difficult to really gauge how the monsoon will come up, how election will what will be the result of that. And plus a lot of unorganized players coming up because of BIS issue. Like we never thought that government will give them a leeway you can enrol after a year. So many things you cannot predict how the things will operate, how government will come with the new policies.\"}, {'chunk_id': 82, 'speaker': 'Sachee Trivedi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Those are like monsoon and election and BIS, I think these are very I mean, I don't think that is frankly, the crux of this. We are talking about a very structural, a very secular shift in demand from open to closed footwear. You look around yourself, there's I mean people are wearing shoes, those athleisure sports shoes. And there is a very structural shift on to online. In fact, online players are having disruption from being from e-commerce to quick commerce and whatnot. So there is a massive disruption happening in channel. Given how widespread you are, given how many contact points, retail points you had, I am surprised that you did not catch on to the changes, the tectonic shift, the structural changes that are happening in the industry?\"}, {'chunk_id': 83, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No. As for that, there's a conflict of channel, general trade versus online channel. There is also too much of discounting pressure on online channel. So strategically, we are there, but we have to be very cautious of our general trade. Our multi-brand outlet, they get suffered when they see too much of discount. This year, we had to actually say no to Flipkart and Amazon because they generally give too much discount and that affects us. So we have to be very cautious in the changing scenario. Things are conflicting. They're very complex also. kind of conflicting and not complementary but sometimes totally opposite. Whatever we think about the general trade, that affects our e-commerce. And when we look for only for e- commerce, then heavy discounting, the sale may go up, but on the long term, our general trade gets affected. So we are grappling with this issue and trying to create a separate range for e- commerce, so that this conflict should get minimized.\"}, {'chunk_id': 84, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And plus, consolidation will happen. Now this year, maybe last 2 years, you can see in online, there are multiple new brands have come up in footwear. Like earlier it was 20 brands, now they are more than 200 brands in footwear. So consolidation will happen. Now discount war will be controlled, like a lot of things are happening in online, yes.'}, {'chunk_id': 85, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'And our two-third business is open footwear, which will never go on e-commerce. Price is low price, masses article. It is not profitable to work on e-commerce on all these masses articles.'}, {'chunk_id': 86, 'speaker': 'Sachee Trivedi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So this disruption because of the online is something to be not taken likely because we are seeing industry after industry being disrupted and completely changed and transformed because of this. Do you feel that this could have a struck, I mean, given your very, very rich experience over decades, do you think this is probably the biggest challenge that you are facing now simply because a shift in nature of demand. And the channel of demand is causing and has allowed a lot many competitors, whether it is people who are coming today and selling maybe for 1 season and going away. But all of a sudden, they have the shelf space that they could never get in physical retail industry. And we are seeing in cosmetics, we are seeing in beauty products, new age players are coming up. They have gained enough critical mass and the old legacy players are really suffering in volumes. Do you think this is the kind of challenge that you are facing? And I'm curious to hear how you place this challenge, the size of this challenge to everything you have seen in the decades of experience that you have?\"}, {'chunk_id': 87, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"So no doubt, things are challenging. We are also mindful of the situation what is unfolding. But we have to see, we have to balance between general trade and e-commerce. In e-commerce, we can't, at the cost of general trade, promote e-commerce. E-commerce, we are mindful. We have started selling as brand as a seller where we can control our pricing also. Earlier, we were selling directly to Flipkart and other distributors, there was no price control, which was affecting our general trade. So we are building our own brand as a seller and trying to sell direct to the consumer and watchful of the situation so that we can co-exist in the general trade also and e-commerce also. And also two-third of the articles that we manufacture, they are meant for the masses. And these masses articles, they are not viable to sell on e-commerce. We have to do that business through general trade only. masses. Now these people are probably not going online also. Why has there been no growth in this masses category over the last almost 3 years now?\"}, {'chunk_id': 88, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No, no. After all, market in open footwear, closed footwear is there. But in the general trade, in the 2 years, the demand has been low. And now in this year, you find a lot of unorganized, low- price articles have entered the market. There is a problem of money in the hand of the masses segment at the moment, what we are witnessing. That is why they are trying to go for cheaper alternatives. But on the long-term, quality articles will also be the aim of the company and that will only help the company. We can't go for reducing the quality or do anything just for the time being.\"}, {'chunk_id': 89, 'speaker': 'Sachee Trivedi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Okay. And actually, if you don't mind, I saw that you have tied up with Disney and Marvel. Does it mean you are going to have some focus on the children's segment?\"}, {'chunk_id': 90, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes. That will help in the premiumization of our articles which are meant for children and others also. So we have done a slow beginning. But in the coming times, this will help us improve the ASP of the company.'}, {'chunk_id': 91, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'The next question is from the line of Devanshu Bansal from Emkay Global.'}, {'chunk_id': 92, 'speaker': 'Devanshu Bansal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Sorry, I've joined the call late, so please pardon me if I'm repeating anything that has been answered before. Sir, I just wanted to check on your remarks that the industry has sort of witnessed an increase in lower priced unorganized competition. So firstly, I wanted to check what exactly is this unorganized competition. So earlier during this entire calendar year, the imports from China, etcetera, were on a decline. But now over the last couple of months, I guess, the imports of such articles have seen an increase. Are you referring to this? Or are you referring to all those smaller-scale MSMEs that are operating from India and they have suddenly increased the competitive intensity in that space?\"}, {'chunk_id': 93, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"Yes, it's actually both. Plus 2 years back, there was a change of GST from 5% to 12%. Since then, like a lot of new players or unorganized competitors have come up. There are multiple reasons for that. One is the lower-priced raw material. When the raw material price goes down, definitely new players come in. And the price goes up, they really vanish. Plus, definitely, we can talk about these are regional players, which have been having no brand, not paying GST. They don't have BIS compliance. So they are taking some market share. And there are a lot of imports happening, like what you were saying about China imports, it has not reduced, but it has increased because government have allowed them until September to import product. After that, they cannot because then the BIS will be applicable. So multiple factors, not one or two.\"}, {'chunk_id': 94, 'speaker': 'Devanshu Bansal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Understood, sir. And secondly, I just wanted to understand from your balance sheet perspective, the inventory levels are sort of up by about 10% odd. So any specific reason for that? demand, that's why inventory has increased.\"}, {'chunk_id': 95, 'speaker': 'Devanshu Bansal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. I just wanted to check because this time around, this festive season has been early. Despite that, the inventory levels are up and receivables are down. So I just wanted to check. I mean, is it like some demand levels in festive also sort of remaining low?'}, {'chunk_id': 96, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So far demand has been subdued, even in the month of September and October. We are hopeful that November onwards things will improve.'}, {'chunk_id': 97, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'The next question is from the line of Lavita from Mirae Asset.'}, {'chunk_id': 98, 'speaker': 'Lavita', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'I have 2 questions. So with respect to how we are positioned in the market, are we seeing any portfolio gaps in the open or closed footwear category since we have seen Crocs being successful last 2, 3 years? The way customers preferences have changed towards more comfort wear and fashion wear. So are we looking at newer categories in any of these open and footwear space? And second question.'}, {'chunk_id': 99, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Continue, please continue.'}, {'chunk_id': 100, 'speaker': 'Lavita', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Okay. So my second question is towards marketing strategies. Are we looking at any differentiated marketing strategy because we see the high-end brands have a different appeal towards the young millennials and customers? So what's your take on that?\"}, {'chunk_id': 101, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So we are in touch with the market constantly. And we are always aligning our portfolio with the market. For example, like from basic slipper, people are moving to colored and printed slippers. So we are going to launch, whatever the gaps in the portfolio, we are at constant touch with the market and giving product accordingly. Secondly, about our marketing strategy, definitely, the way world is moving, we are also moving from offline to online advertising. So we are doing a lot of branding in the digital space now.'}, {'chunk_id': 102, 'speaker': 'Lavita', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So I wanted to understand more on the specific categories. Is there a trend that is where we have not looked at? Is there something, any space in any particular category that we have not looked at and we are approaching towards it? And in terms of marketing, more towards different message that we can, a unique way of marketing strategy apart from being there online, which everybody else is? That's all.\"}, {'chunk_id': 103, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So when you talk about the product gaps or portfolio gaps, like definitely, marketing is shifting from sportswear to athleisure. So we are in touch with the market, be it people are going for chunky soles or different color, different design. So we keep on doing this analysis and introduce products accordingly.'}, {'chunk_id': 104, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Now sneakers at the moment.'}, {'chunk_id': 105, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes, the sneakers, like you know the sneaker trend is there. The street fashion is there. So we are in line with the market trend and launching products accordingly.'}, {'chunk_id': 106, 'speaker': 'Devanshu Bansal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'My question is, sir, in India, there is a lot of footwear parks that are being created in Tamil Nadu, right, where all large Taiwan-based players are entering the space. Haryana is a state also has similar advantage from a cost of labor perspective, the footwear industry is quite well established in the state. Any thoughts around this incremental Make In India opportunity that is emerging? So your comments on that please.'}, {'chunk_id': 107, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So in Tamil Nadu, whatever manufacturers, they are coming there from Taiwan. They are making for multinationals. And mostly they are making and then exporting.

Any thoughts around that?'}, {'chunk_id': 109, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No, we have to see what is required by Indian market, Indian consumer and what kind of the masses consumer that we have. How we have to address their needs.

That's what we are focusing on.\"}, {'chunk_id': 110, 'speaker': 'Devanshu Bansal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Understood. And sir, there were some news reports, thought it was not wide, but there were some news reports on this GST being reduced from 12% to 5%, right, for footwear. So any thoughts around that? Any representations being a leader that you have made to the government because there has been a lot of disruptions, right, because of this unorganized lower price competition that is there, any thoughts on this thing?'}, {'chunk_id': 111, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes, representation by the industry is being made regularly at regular intervals.

The separate portfolio for e-commerce that you have mentioned, any timeline that you can share by when do you expect to launch this? And is it going to be margin dilutive because this is being done primarily to bypass the e-commerce channels, discounting nature and its effect on GT?'}, {'chunk_id': 116, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CFO)', 'text': 'So we have already bifurcated the online portfolio, e-commerce portfolio. Now second question is about the margin dilution. So we are not going to dilute our margins in that category.'}, {'chunk_id': 117, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Then sir, how does it address the issue, which is basically the online players discounting and that affecting the channel? How does it affect that issue? I mean if we are not going to participate, then how is the separate portfolio going to help? offering huge discounts. Other small activities or any other days, we will be there. Our only thing is to protect the interest of both channels. We have to see about the brand also, at what level we can give discount. And it should be in concurrence with us, how they decide the discounting policy. It cannot be wherever they want, they can give what kind of discount they can offer like. So we are focusing on more of BAS, branded as a seller, compared to giving outright sale to them.'}, {'chunk_id': 118, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Agreed. But when this separate portfolio, you will still be brand as a seller. You're not going to outright sell to the Flipkarts and Amazons.\"}, {'chunk_id': 119, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'In that scenario, it depends upon what will be the discounting philosophy of that brand. For example, Flipkart, we will not participate when the higher discounting are happening.'}, {'chunk_id': 120, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"And how does it work? So the discount is borne by the Flipkart and Amazon? Or it's kind of shared between you and...\"}, {'chunk_id': 121, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': 'See, on the special days like Big Billion Day or Amazon Festival, they give from their side without taking any approval from us or sitting together and deciding the price. So they just, whatever they feel like, they give discounts. So we do not appreciate like this kind of discounting practice.'}, {'chunk_id': 122, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'We have to protect our general trade also.'}, {'chunk_id': 123, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"But, sir, if the portfolio is bifurcated, it will protect, right? I mean I'm not able to understand this. So I understand the brand image part.\"}, {'chunk_id': 124, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (Executive)', 'text': 'So we have to be mindful of both the things. General trade, once you make the articles separate, okay, that thing is there.

We have to balance out all these things and take a very cautious move.'}, {'chunk_id': 125, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it, sir. Second question, and I heard this during the course of the call that BIS for smaller players, you mentioned that a leeway of 1 year has been given, but my understanding was that right now, there is no such deadline to comply for small and micro enterprises.

We have already uploaded the earnings press release and the investor presentation on the stock exchanges as well at our website and hope that you have had the opportunity to go through those. Before we begin the question-answer session, let me quickly go through the Q4 and FY24 performance, starting with Q4. During Q4FY24, we recorded revenue of Rs. 747 crores as compared to Rs. 765 crores in Q4FY23, reporting a marginal decline of 2.3% year-on-year on account of slight decline in volumes. EBITDA for the quarter was at Rs. 120 crores, up by 2% year-on-year from Rs. 118 crores in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. EBITDA margins were up marginally by 69 basis points and stood at 16.1% in Q4FY24 as against 15.4% in Q4FY23. PAT was at Rs. 61 crores as compared to Rs. 63 crores reported in Q4FY23. PAT margin for Q4FY24 remained flat at around 8.2%. Now coming on the full year FY24. We have achieved a moderate growth of 4.7% year-on-year from Rs. 2,783 crores in FY23 to Rs. 2,914 crores in FY24. This performance was largely driven by a significant uptick in open footwear volumes, a witness to the efficacy of our strategic initiatives to regain market share. EBITDA for the year was at Rs. 407 crores as against Rs. 336 crores in FY23, registering a growth of 21.1%. EBITDA margin was at 14%, improved by 188 basis points year-on-year as against 12.1% in FY23. Margins majorly benefited from the softening of raw material prices, which was partially offset by the increased fixed costs. PAT was at Rs. 200 crores in FY24 as compared to Rs. 154 crores in FY23, recording a significant growth of 29.8%. PAT margin was 6.9% during FY24 against 5.6% in FY23, improving by 133 basis points year-on-year. In FY24, the company incurred a total CapEx of Rs. 248 crores, including a purchase of 30-acre land parcel in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, worth Rs. 127 crores. We remain a net debt-free company recognition. We continue to explore new avenues and focus on other new channels and e- commerce platforms for growth. We are confident that our ongoing efforts will lead to favourable results for us in the future. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.'}, {'chunk_id': 5, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you very much. We will now begin with the question-and-answer session. First question is from the line of Shirish Pardeshi from Centrum Broking. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 6, 'speaker': 'Shirish Pardeshi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Just two questions in the beginning. This 5 crores pieces what we have sold in Q4 against 5.1 crores in the Q1. So can you give some more colour what segment, which segment and which markets is driving this? And something more on the inventory side, is the inventory is now under control in the field? Or do you think it will take some more time? And the second question is on the pricing bit. What kind of pricing aspiration we will hold or we will continue the similar price over FY ‚Äò25?'}, {'chunk_id': 7, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes. This is Gaurav. Just to answer your question. Q4, when we started, there was a QC order, BIS was implemented. So if you see that subdued growth or a little minus coming in, that the main reason was that we were implementing BIS. So there was some confusion in the market, how it will be implemented. So we increased price marginally. And then we saw that we were able to implement all this BIS. And what is the second question?'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'Shirish Pardeshi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'I think the growth, what we have seen in a number of pairs. So Q1 was 5.1 and Q4 has come back to 5 crores. So any colour on what kind of growth we are seeing in number of pairs, which is now remained at 5 crores on an average?'}, {'chunk_id': 9, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No, our month January was affected because of BIS. That's why we're not able to cover that, we could not cross that 5.1 crores figures.\"}, {'chunk_id': 10, 'speaker': 'Shirish Pardeshi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'If the similar trend has continued? And the question was, the parallel question was that whether the inventory is now adjusted or normalized or still there will be some effect, which can be seen in Q1?'}, {'chunk_id': 11, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So inventory is now normalized. There's no problem with inventory. And I think now the things have started picking up in the market.\"}, {'chunk_id': 12, 'speaker': 'Shirish Pardeshi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Okay. And the second question is that in terms of pricing aspiration, what should we look in FY '25 is the price increases will happen? Or will remain as where we are?\"}, {'chunk_id': 13, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'The pricing depends upon our cost of the inputs. If the input remains stable, then prices also remain stable. So by and large, we have to make sure we are always competitive in the markets, keeping that thing in view, we have our pricing strategy.'}, {'chunk_id': 14, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Next question is from the line of Devanshu Bansal from Emkay Global. is the expected increase in the capacity with this new addition?'}, {'chunk_id': 15, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Capacity utilization is around 65%. And on the land parcel that we have bought, we have to always stay ahead of the curve where land searching is always time-consuming. So for future growth, we have land in our hand. So whenever we want to increase production, then we have to start the process of building the factory because we are always having greenfield projects. And then we take steps accordingly. So that is something keeping future in view that we have acquired this land.'}, {'chunk_id': 16, 'speaker': 'Devanshu Bansal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Understood, sir. And a follow-up to this is, there is a lot of substandard open footwear being imported as of now, which should, in my opinion, at least be restricted after BIS implementation. So is this capacity expansion somewhat factoring in restricted imports from other countries? Which may sort of lead to higher demand from local players like Relaxo?'}, {'chunk_id': 17, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Earlier also before implementation of BIS, the product category we were in by and large our Hawaii segment, nothing was imported. It is only where footwear industry was not able to make that kind of products, they were being imported. Now after this kind of restriction, definitely some shoes, some EVA slippers their import will be restricted. Particularly low quality the EVA slipper were being imported. So there will be a restriction on that. Indirectly, we may have some benefit. Let us wait and see.'}, {'chunk_id': 18, 'speaker': 'Devanshu Bansal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Yes, sir. That's what I'm trying to ask. So is this benefit going to be large in quantum? Or is it just a small benefit that can come to a place like Relaxo?\"}, {'chunk_id': 19, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"I don't think it is going to be very large. Overall import was hardly 5%-6% of the Indian consumption. That is going to be restricted.\"}, {'chunk_id': 20, 'speaker': 'Devanshu Bansal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Understood, sir. And one last question is our ROE is currently at 8%-10% over the last 2 years. So how do you see these levels? And any trajectory that you would like to sort of highlight in the initiatives that the company is taking to improve this?'}, {'chunk_id': 21, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"ROE definitely because the profits were under pressure in the last 2-3 years. So that's why it has come down, and we have added more assets in the system. So, from next year or in coming time growth will be there. So it will improve definitely.\"}, {'chunk_id': 22, 'speaker': 'Devanshu Bansal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. Last, sorry, final bookkeeping question is, sir, while revenues have grown by about only 4%-5% in this year, the receivable increase is about 30-odd percent. Is this something a one-off? Or why is this number increased at FY24 end?'}, {'chunk_id': 23, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'This has increased because there is a pressure in the market. The demand is subdued. So because of pressure in the market, there is an increase of the outstanding. So the payments are slow, you can say, the payment is slow in the market.'}, {'chunk_id': 24, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Next question is from the line of Prerna Jhunjhunwala from Elara Capital.'}, {'chunk_id': 25, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"See, as you see, the sports segment is growing faster than the open footwear category. But last year, what we have seen is that open has grown more than the closed footwear, sport shoes. So the industry, if you talk about 3 to 4 years' time. Sports footwear or closed footwear will definitely exceed in growth compared to the open footwear.\"}, {'chunk_id': 26, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. And what are our current capacities if you see the breakup of the two? And what is the revenue share of the two segments?'}, {'chunk_id': 27, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'See, as company Relaxo as a whole, our closed footwear contributes 20%, and open footwear contributes 80%. But one of the brand, which is Sparx, there, it is 60% closed and 40% open. So we are trying to grow this category - Sparx, which has more contribution of closed footwear.'}, {'chunk_id': 28, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. And why was closed footwear under pressure this year? I did not understand that part?'}, {'chunk_id': 29, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': \"So that is because of the demand. A lot of new entrants have come in the market and the price what they are offering. But there's more supply than demand in the last 2 years. A lot of capacity has been put-in by the other players.\"}, {'chunk_id': 30, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. So you mean there is an oversupply of product in the market?'}, {'chunk_id': 31, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Local players are there, yes.'}, {'chunk_id': 32, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So you see that oversupply correcting in how much time? Is it fair to ask, I mean, understand that? Or it will be on market forces?'}, {'chunk_id': 33, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Kumaar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"It depends on the market. It's dependent on the market. But consolidation will happen definitely.\"}, {'chunk_id': 34, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. And will you please help us understand the brand-wise revenue share as well?'}, {'chunk_id': 35, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"Already we have shared in our investor presentation, but even then, I can tell you. So Relaxo, it's contributing, Relaxo with Bahamas, 25%. And then Sparx and Flite both are equal, so 25% Relaxo plus Bahamas and rest 50-50 Sparx and Flite.\"}, {'chunk_id': 36, 'speaker': 'Prerna Jhunjhunwala', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. So Relaxo and Bahamas 25%, Flite 25%?'}, {'chunk_id': 37, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sparx is 37%. So 50% of 75 divided by 2, 37.5% roughly half-half.'}, {'chunk_id': 38, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Next question is from the line of Videesha Sheth from Ambit Capital.'}, {'chunk_id': 39, 'speaker': 'Videesha Sheth', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"My first question is on the market share. In 2Q, you had mentioned about gaining market share that was lost in FY '23. So any comments on how market share has moved in the second half of the year? That is my first question. our volume growth is more than the value growth.\"}, {'chunk_id': 40, 'speaker': 'Videesha Sheth', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay.

It was low density polyethylene also, PVC also. All polymers, they became volatile. Because we have to keep, I mean, a good inventory of all these things. And that was the reason for that. Otherwise, generally, we are beneficial in the rising market. We always have good inventory. This is the first time when it rose to Rs. 300 and then came down Rs. 150.

EBITDA recorded a strong 54% Y-on-Y growth at Rs. 92 crores as against Rs. 59 crores in the corresponding quarter of last year. Softening of raw material prices and better operational efficiency due to economies of scale enabled us to enhance our EBITDA margin by 392 bps in this quarter. EBITDA margin was at 12.8% in Q2 FY24 as against 8.9% in Q2 FY23. PAT almost doubled in this quarter at Rs. 44 crores as against Rs. 22 crores in Q2 FY23. PAT margin stood at 6.2%, up 283 bps from 3.3% in Q2 FY23. In H1 FY24 we recorded a revenue of Rs. 1,454 crores vis-√†-vis Rs. 1,337 crores in H1 FY23, an increase of 9% year-on-year basis. EBITDA was at Rs. 199 crores from Rs. 146 crores in same period of last year, up by 37%. EBITDA margin was at 13.7% as compared to 10.9% in H1 FY23, an expansion of 280 bps. PAT for H1 FY24 at Rs. 101 crores against Rs. 61 crores in H1 FY23, grew by 65%. PAT margin was at 6.9% as compared to 4.6% in H1 FY23. The company incurred a CAPEX of Rs. 56 crores as on 31st September ‚Äô23. We remain a net debt-free Company with positive cash from operations.

I was asking about, till last year you were talking about premiumization of the entire product category. But since last year you have taken price corrections. So, exactly what kind of strategy you are looking at? Higher number of pairs to be sold and with less value or other way around. That‚Äôs the first question.'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': 'Last year we did some price correction. Before that we had lost some market share to competition. After price correction we have regained our market share. So, our volume growth has been more than 20%.

So, that focus is there, and it will continue.'}, {'chunk_id': 9, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'But the loss of market share was due to higher prices of your products or was there any other reason for that?'}, {'chunk_id': 10, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Last year because of higher, we had a lot of old stock, costly inventory in the system.

Just a last question on ROE and ROCE which has been falling from last two three years. What‚Äôs your strategy on that front?'}, {'chunk_id': 14, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Strategy because margins are under pressure, so once things will settle so definitely ROE and ROI will better because then capacity utilization and more earning will be there.

But when the volume goes up our sale go up then H2 is going to better than H1, so things will improve.'}, {'chunk_id': 21, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Due to operating leverage you will gain the margin, right?'}, {'chunk_id': 22, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Automatically because of operating leverage our EBITDA will improve.'}, {'chunk_id': 23, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So, what's the capacity utilization you are working at currently, at Q2 what was it and what do you expect to be?\"}, {'chunk_id': 24, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Currently it is 63% utilization.'}, {'chunk_id': 25, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'That is for Q2 you are talking, right?'}, {'chunk_id': 26, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'H1 we are talking about; it is around 63%.'}, {'chunk_id': 27, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay.

Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 31, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yeah, Thank you so much for the opportunity. I had a question on your closed footwear. So, we had a very good trade show I think a couple of months back where we had displayed the entire range of our closed sportswear. I just wanted to understand a couple of things. First is Q3 typically is your large quarter for sportswear. So, how is the initial response and what is the kind of demand and growth that we are seeing? Our composition of sportswear‚ÄîI think correct me if I‚Äôm wrong‚Äîis somewhere about Rs. 250 and 300 crores. So, what kind of growth we expect? And our competitor has had a significant size and I think we‚Äôve also had aspiration to grow significantly, so do you think this is a category which can be somewhere close to like a Rs. 1,000 crores contributor to you in probably a few years?'}, {'chunk_id': 32, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'You are right that this category has huge potential to grow and what you‚Äôre saying Rs. 1,000 crores, maybe in 2-3 years we will definitely plan to grow to that level. Regarding the market situation as you know the market is still not picked up what we were expecting. So, we have done lot of retail meets across India and distributor meets. The initial response because of this Pitrupaksha and untimely rains, market has still not given good feedback till now in terms of uptake in the market. So, it‚Äôs too early. Diwali is in November, so we are expecting November should be better.'}, {'chunk_id': 33, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, our base would be very low, so of course from that base we should see a very good performance even in Q3. And just a follow up over there is that one feedback on the ground is that the margins in the sportswear is not very compelling and therefore Relaxo sportswear is not very well received by the distributors and retailers. Have we made any changes over there? Do you think we have addressed the issues at the distributor level?'}, {'chunk_id': 34, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, we have made no changes since last 4-5 years. And regarding distributors they are always complaint about margin. That is their trade habit. They need more margins. So, we are having the fixed margin which we have not changed from last 5 years.'}, {'chunk_id': 35, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Even in the sportswear?'}, {'chunk_id': 36, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, it‚Äôs same. We have not changed.'}, {'chunk_id': 37, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it. Okay and in Q3 from the last year‚Äôs base do you think this quarter will considering the kind of market weaknesses there we should expect things to only recover after a couple of quarters. You think Q3 because of a low base we can expect strong growth from sportswear.'}, {'chunk_id': 38, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, we are keeping our fingers crossed and last 7 months has not been so encouraging. In terms of the uptake of this sports footwear. The market is still a little challenging. So, we are just hoping for the best that this should now pick up. It‚Äôs been 7 months like market is not responding.'}, {'chunk_id': 39, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Thank you.

My first question is regarding the market share. You said we have gained the lost market share. So, what‚Äôs the current market share?'}, {'chunk_id': 41, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'In volume if you talk about at a Company level, last year if you see we lost around 20%-25% in volume, drop was there in the open footwear which caused Hawaii and Flite, that only we have regained it back.

Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 49, 'speaker': 'Abhishek Getam', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'My question was regarding premiumization strategy. So, largely our open footwear are sub Rs. 200 ASP. What are our plans going ahead to bring whole portfolio level or footwear level to a higher ASP? I mean sort of the whole Company portfolio in the range of Rs. 500+ ASP and what strategy would we go for, Tier 1 or Tier 2, 3?'}, {'chunk_id': 50, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'If you remember we have taken the last price cut of rationalized price in September. So, since then, the prices were less. Now if you see October that ASP has increased and regarding the premiumization, we have brands like in Flite we have launched Urban Basics which is again Rs. 400+ MRP. We are working on the portfolio of Sparx which is more than Rs. 1000 to 1500 MRP. So, we are continuously working on our portfolio to increase the ASP and improve on premiumization.'}, {'chunk_id': 51, 'speaker': 'Abhishek Getam', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Understood. So, what part would be Rs. 500 plus ASP contributing to our revenue?'}, {'chunk_id': 52, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"It's roughly around 10%.\"}, {'chunk_id': 53, 'speaker': 'Abhishek Getam', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Where do we see this to achieve involved in terms? Do we see this to improve this 50% sort of in a longer-term horizon (+5) year?'}, {'chunk_id': 54, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': 'No. Our 80% as on day business comes from open footwear. The Company is focused on serving masses. 20% is coming from our closed footwear. That is why average comes out low. But our focus is there of premiumization whether it is Bahamas, Flite or Sparx. So, maybe 20% of that will ultimately build up premium.'}, {'chunk_id': 55, 'speaker': 'Abhishek Getam', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, down the line like 4-5 years down the line we can expect it to 30%-35% sort of contributor?'}, {'chunk_id': 56, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'We have to see what kind of traction we get from these categories.'}, {'chunk_id': 57, 'speaker': 'Abhishek Getam', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay Sir, Thank You Sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 58, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank You.

Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 116, 'speaker': 'Akhil Parekh', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Thanks for the opportunity. My first question is what the possible reasons for the demand weakness could be, now given that we have already taken price corrections and it's almost two quarters now. So, if you can highlight broader reasons probably why the demand continues to be weak?\"}, {'chunk_id': 117, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So, consumer sentiment has been sluggish in the mass segment and that we are witnessing across the country and whole footwear category we are seeing that the sentiments are not that great. So, that's why if the industry does not grow then there will be little challenge. We are seeing this because of monsoon, inflation. That rural market is definitely not responding.\"}, {'chunk_id': 118, 'speaker': 'Akhil Parekh', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'That I understand that the sluggishness is there in mass segment but unfortunately none of the companies have been able to clarify what are the clear reasons, why we are seeing this pressure given that the inflation has already started to decrease.'}, {'chunk_id': 119, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, but the demand at rural markets should also be there. We are seeing that walk ins of consumers are not that which was before. So, maybe the discretionary spent at rural level is not there. We can assume that.'}, {'chunk_id': 120, 'speaker': 'Akhil Parekh', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Has that started to improve now given the festival already started? Do we see that improvement now in month of October?'}, {'chunk_id': 121, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"It's too early to comment upon it. We are waiting for this season. This may improve or maybe November-December things may improve.\"}, {'chunk_id': 122, 'speaker': 'Akhil Parekh', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Second is if you could just update on the DMS 2.0 implementation which we have been talking about since last few quarters. Have we seen any, how far we have reached in terms of implementation and are we seeing any positive impact? Because one common feedback we were getting is the wholesaler were undercutting on pricing basically. If you can just highlight something on DMS.'}, {'chunk_id': 123, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So, DMS 2.0 now 50% of our distributor we have implemented this 2.0 and our plan is in next 3 months we'll make it 100%. Regarding price cut, price cut by distributor we have not seen that. But maybe it's not in the DMS that they can cut the price. DMS is just to get the inventory and how we can do secondary with them and align our schemes accordingly. DMS is not implemented to control the distributor discount to the retailer. It is mainly to drive the secondary and have the control how things are going.\"}, {'chunk_id': 124, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you.

What is the revenue on the geographic basis and what are the efforts you are putting in to increase our market share in south?'}, {'chunk_id': 148, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, if you see we are doing 45% coming from north zone, followed by east zone of 22%, then west 20% and 15% is south.

The next question is on the line of Sachee Trivedi from Trident Capital. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 153, 'speaker': 'Sachee Trivedi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you for taking my question. The question I have is that in a previous earnings call, you had indicated that Sparx revenue will go from Rs. 400 crores to around Rs. 1,000 crores over the next 2-3 years which I think was around FY26. Is that still something in your plan and if yes then how do you plan to execute towards this goal?'}, {'chunk_id': 154, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"Though this year has been a little challenging. But our focus on premiumization is particularly in Sparx category and particularly on shoes and this year there are a lot of premium articles in Sparx, and we are getting a good traction. Based on our experience we are focusing on this and likely to grow but not this year. It is a year of stabilization and improvement and learning and accordingly then we'll open retail outlets also, we will utilize e-commerce also, the things will go accordingly.\"}, {'chunk_id': 155, 'speaker': 'Sachee Trivedi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Your other expenses have gone up 24% year-on-year.

Is this to help the Sparx brand or is this for everything, all the product categories?\"}, {'chunk_id': 156, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'All brands are being advertised. Marketing expense spends are in all brands.'}, {'chunk_id': 157, 'speaker': 'Sachee Trivedi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay, Now in terms of your distribution channels you have the MBO, you have the EBO, and you have the online channel. Do you think you should be looking at a differential pricing across these three channels given that the customer that comes to your e-commerce channel is very different from a customer that comes to your MBO channel?'}, {'chunk_id': 158, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"So, if you see instead of having different pricing, we have different brand offerings. So, Sparx is more relevant for EBOs and online because it's more than Rs. 1000 MRP. And for the mass market or MBO outlets which are 1 lakh outlet across India, for them we have Hawaii and we have Flite and Bahamas brand. So, we have segmented brand according to the price rather than giving different discounts.\"}, {'chunk_id': 159, 'speaker': 'Sachee Trivedi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"And then one question on your MBO market particularly in the rural segment, should we think of it as a consumer discretionary spend or is it actually an important spend because if somebody's chappal is broken then they need to replace it? And then the question is why are they not buying a Relaxo brand to replace the chappal and going for something else?\"}, {'chunk_id': 160, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"What we have seen is that because of inflation their visits have been little reduced. So, that's why what we are seeing is that the payments are not coming from the distributor and from the retailers. So, because of inflation and their discretionary spend going down, they are little selective in buying. That is the trend from last 6 months. But we are hoping that this will improve because of festive season coming and stabilization of prices are there. Raw material has been stabilized, so there should be an uptake in the demand.\"}, {'chunk_id': 161, 'speaker': 'Sachee Trivedi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"But that is assuming that this is a consumer discretionary spend and I'm wondering if in the rural market this is actually a consumer staple item.\"}, {'chunk_id': 162, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"If you have seen we have grown in volume, so we have definitely gained the market share there also.

Thank you for joining us on this earnings call for the quarter and fiscal year ended 31st March 2023. The earning press release and the investor presentation have been uploaded on the stock exchange as well as at our website, and we hope you have had the chance to go through these. Before we begin the question and answer, I will quickly go through the Q4 and FY '23 performance starting with Q4. In Q4 FY '23, we recorded revenue of INR 765 crores as against INR 698 crores in Q4 FY '22, recording a growth of 10% year-on-year. On a Q-on-Q basis, the revenue increased by 12%. This is mainly due to volume growth across all categories. Our Q4 FY '23 EBITDA was at INR 118 crores, up by 6% year-on-year, from INR 111 crores in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. EBITDA margins were at 15.4% in Q4 FY '23 as against 15.9% in the corresponding quarter. On a Q-on-Q basis, EBITDA margins have grown substantially by 481 basis points due to the selling of low cost inventory along with costly old inventory. PAT at INR63 crores, on a sequential basis, that grew by 110% from INR30 crores in Q3 FY '23. PAT margin for Q4 FY '23 was 8.3%. Our price correction efforts during the last quarter have resulted in good momentum, and we have continued our market share recovery in all major segments during this quarter without relying much on discounts and offers. Now moving on to full year FY '23. Despite the challenging environment last year, our strong team responded effectively and our commitment to maintaining our high standard of excellence have made us successful. Revenue for FY '23 was at INR 2,783 crores, up by 5% year-on-year from INR 2,653 crores in FY '22. EBITDA was at INR 336 crores as against INR 416 crores in FY '22. EBITDA margin was at 12.1% as against 15.7% in FY '22. Margins were affected We are now a debt-free company with robust cash flow from operation due to our strong working capital management. During the year, the company incurred a capex of INR 174 crores. With the stabilization of raw fuel prices in Q4, we are currently experiencing strong demand and hold an optimistic view of the future. Our company is strategically positioned to take advantage of the opportunities within the industry, allowing us to further expand our market share. Our key strengths lie in our in-house manufacturing capabilities, the quality of our product, and the strong recall of our brand. We remain dedicated to upholding these strengths and will persistently strive to maintain their integrity. We are confident that our continued efforts will lead positive outcome for us in the time ahead. Thank you. Now we can open the floor for questions.\"}, {'chunk_id': 6, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'The first question comes from the line of Aliasgar Shakir from Motilal Oswal.'}, {'chunk_id': 7, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Congratulations to finally seeing a good market share trend in your company. I have 3 questions. First is on the current quarter. So I understand from our channel checks that post cleanup of the old inventory, market demand has picked up quite strongly. And in fact, Relaxo has not been able to meet all the distributor demand. So is this true in multiple geographies? And do you think we would have lost any revenue because of that factor, if you could just quantify what could have been the impact of that in this quarter? And has that been now subsided? Or we are still seeing demand not being able to fully be met?'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'What you said is partly correct, that there is an upsurge in demand, and we are seeing it. One reason is that we have corrected the prices. And second, this is a peak season for us for open footwear. As we are 75% open and 25% closed, so this is the open footwear starting from January to June to July. And regarding the shortages, we are managing. We have inventory with us and the uptake we are seeing across India for the open footwear.'}, {'chunk_id': 9, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it. So can you quantify if we would have lost any revenue because of that in this quarter? And has that been now subsided?'}, {'chunk_id': 10, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'It happened in February because there were some IT issues, which have been corrected. And now we are able to cover. We have sufficient inventory.'}, {'chunk_id': 11, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. Got it. Second question is on your margins. So while we have significantly reduced prices, we have seen impact on margins. So can you share, I mean, what is the trend we should expect in the coming quarters as raw material prices are also softening? Should we see that helping us and therefore the impact on margin that we saw in this quarter should improve? How should we see that?'}, {'chunk_id': 12, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Market remains challenging, and we have to be very cautious with respect to our pricing of our articles so that we always have a good market share as far as sales are concerned. The EBITDA margin that you have seen in this quarter is likely to continue, and there is likely to be some improvement also.'}, {'chunk_id': 13, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Some improvement, yes.'}, {'chunk_id': 14, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Understood. And just last question on the closed footwear in the sportswear category. I understand that we have made a lot of changes in our design team, online team. If you could share some thoughts in terms of what is the strategy in the sportswear in terms of new product development and what is the aim in the next 3 - 4 years. Can we expect to reach about INR 1,000 crores in 3 - 4 years' time? I mean, if you can just share what is your strategy there.\"}, {'chunk_id': 15, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"So if you talk about Sparx sports shoes, we have seen healthy growth. We have done roughly around 25% growth. And before that, last year, we put up a plant to cater to this need. So still, the plant capacity still we have. It will take 2 - 3 years to reach to that level, and you're talking about INR1,000 crores, Sparx is already INR1,000-plus crores brand.\"}, {'chunk_id': 16, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes. But sports wear would be relatively lower? Or I mean, of course, Sparx is much bigger, but within that sportswear, if you could just quantify how much would that be?'}, {'chunk_id': 17, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So that is roughly around -- we do sports shoes and all sports category, roughly around INR 400 crores. So definitely, we have aspirations to become INR1,000 crores. And it will take 2 years, 3 years, time will tell.'}, {'chunk_id': 18, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Next question comes from the line of Vikas Jain from Equirus.'}, {'chunk_id': 19, 'speaker': 'Vikas Jain', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'For the first question, definitely, we have seen a market share which you have regained from which we were lost to our earlier competitors. So at this point of time, can you really say that you have regained almost all of the market share or some part of it is still left?'}, {'chunk_id': 20, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Can you repeat the question? It's not so clear.\"}, {'chunk_id': 21, 'speaker': 'Vikas Jain', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'I was mentioning about the market share. So have you like reached -- regained the entire market share and reached to what we were at the pre-COVID times? Or probably some part of it is still more or less left to gain?'}, {'chunk_id': 22, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': \"Yes, definitely, what we have lost market share in last quarter 1 or quarter 2 last year, we are seeing the good momentum now, and we are gaining the market share back. So definitely, we will recover -- we have recovered. Now we'll recover more.\"}, {'chunk_id': 23, 'speaker': 'Vikas Jain', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, second question with respect to the demand. Well, Ramesh sir did mention that the demand environment continues to remain challenging. So probably, is it like the -- how would you -- some comments with respect to how the underlying market is growing, and what do you think it will take for the market to normalize in what time period according to your estimates?'}, {'chunk_id': 24, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So actually, what we are hearing from the market that this Eid and this festive, there is a demand contraction happening in some parts of India. Rural India is still not able to cover up what it was contributing. But I think this is a temporary phenomenon. The inflation is now getting controlled, and we'll definitely see the uptake in coming quarters. contribution from the all 4 North, West, East and South?\"}, {'chunk_id': 25, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (Executive)', 'text': 'So North contribute maximum to around 44%; followed by East, 22%; 20% is West and 15% is South. And we are maintaining this from last year, it is similar.'}, {'chunk_id': 26, 'speaker': 'Vikas Jain', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. And with respect to more distributors adding in the South, is that on time? Or how many have you added this year probably?'}, {'chunk_id': 27, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So it's not a great achievement in adding more distributors. We have maintained what we were having. So always, there will be a churn, new addition and some people leaving. So it's roughly around same.\"}, {'chunk_id': 28, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Next question comes from the line of Kaustubh Pawaskar from Sharekhan By BNP Paribas.'}, {'chunk_id': 29, 'speaker': 'Kaustubh Pawaskar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So my question is on the price cut what we have taken to. So we have taken the price cut to reduce the pricing gap between the lower -- products which are around less than your price point products. But since you said that raw materials pricing had all corrected, have we seen any price reduction undertaken by those bottom of the pyramid players or lower price point players in the market? And because of which, again, the pricing difference what you were planning to reduce, it has again gone up. Any sense on that?'}, {'chunk_id': 30, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No. Now our prices are very competitive and there is no room for further price cuts. And even on competition, while we are very competitive, there's no issue. I don't think that there's any room -- competitor can do much about it.\"}, {'chunk_id': 31, 'speaker': 'Kaustubh Pawaskar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Okay. So you don't see any further price that's happening in the market, right?\"}, {'chunk_id': 32, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'No, no. Not so.'}, {'chunk_id': 33, 'speaker': 'Kaustubh Pawaskar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Okay, okay. And sir, my second question, you have been consistently talking about expanding your capacity. So any guidance for capex going ahead and where you're planning to add capacity?\"}, {'chunk_id': 34, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So last year, whatever capacity we wanted to expand, that has been expanded.'}, {'chunk_id': 35, 'speaker': 'Kaustubh Pawaskar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. So there is not going to be...'}, {'chunk_id': 36, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"This year only, money is going on moulds, which are regular kind of things, some repair, moulds and backward integration, some capital asset generation, that's it.\"}, {'chunk_id': 37, 'speaker': 'Kaustubh Pawaskar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Okay. Any thoughts on your retail expansion front? By FY '23, how much was your reach and where you want to take it over the next 2 years?\"}, {'chunk_id': 38, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Earlier, we were maintaining around 400. Now, we are expanding this year.'}, {'chunk_id': 39, 'speaker': 'Kaustubh Pawaskar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Can you provide some numbers on this, sir?'}, {'chunk_id': 40, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Next question comes from the line of Onkar Ghugardare from Shree Investments.'}, {'chunk_id': 41, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"My question was regarding -- it's from your investor presentation. So from FY '21 to FY '23, the average realization has gone up, but the number of pairs sold has decreased. So -- and in this quarter, the average realization has gone down significantly. But the number of pairs sold has been -- has increased dramatically. So like what's the management's view on this going forward? What would be the average cost of pairs or like how it is supposed to be in the future?\"}, {'chunk_id': 42, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Last year, we had done major correction in some of our categories like Hawaii, EVA. So that was the reason that the average selling price has gone down. And our volume has gone up. So that is why volume is going up because the average rate has gone down, only because of reduction in prices.'}, {'chunk_id': 43, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So from here on, what we can expect, a stabilization here? Or like...'}, {'chunk_id': 44, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Stabilization, by and large stabilization.'}, {'chunk_id': 45, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Okay. You don't see any upside from here on?\"}, {'chunk_id': 46, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'On the whole year side because in this quarter, mostly open footwear was in demand. Closed footwear counts in winter season. So overall in the year, again, you will see our last year average price of INR 160 will be back.'}, {'chunk_id': 47, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. So for the current financial year, you are expecting around INR160 per pair realization?'}, {'chunk_id': 48, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Could be a little higher, also depending upon the shoes. If they're a little better, then things will be further. But around INR160, INR165, we can expect average.\"}, {'chunk_id': 49, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. And what about the number of pairs? I mean, what could be the ballpark estimate for that?'}, {'chunk_id': 50, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Definitely further. From the Last year, we expect double-digit growth in volume for this year.'}, {'chunk_id': 51, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. So around double-digit volume growth and around similar kind of average realization per pair or somewhat higher?'}, {'chunk_id': 52, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes.'}, {'chunk_id': 53, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Okay. As far as the ROE and ROC is concerned, what's your plan on next 2 - 3 years since it has come down dramatically, again, from FY '21 to FY '23?\"}, {'chunk_id': 54, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"Definitely, it will improve in coming years because last year was a tough year, profits were under pressure, and we did capex also. Next year, definitely, it will be much better than this FY '23. We can compare with FY '22, it was well.\"}, {'chunk_id': 55, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Because it has now come down to a single digit now. That's what -- that's why I'm asking.\"}, {'chunk_id': 56, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. As far as the demand outlook is concerned, how are you seeing currently this shaping up?'}, {'chunk_id': 57, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So currently, there is a little challenge in the market. There is a little demand contraction. But I think going forward, quarter 2, quarter 3 onwards, we will be better.'}, {'chunk_id': 58, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. In the current quarter, you are facing some demand issues?'}, {'chunk_id': 59, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Yes. Because what we hearing from the market that's still rural is not back on track. It's going to take a little time.\"}, {'chunk_id': 60, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. Any update on what could be the export percentage? And how -- is there any opportunity for Relaxo? Or like the home market is so large that everyone bothered to think about -- or bothered to think about the export market?'}, {'chunk_id': 61, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': \"Exports we have done around 4%, 4.5% of total revenue. And the way we are growing the last 2 - 3 years' time, we're giving -- getting double-digit growth. And we are -- in the future also, we are expecting the same. Growth will sustain.\"}, {'chunk_id': 62, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. The margins or they are better than the home market or like how it is?'}, {'chunk_id': 63, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'It is like similar.'}, {'chunk_id': 64, 'speaker': 'Onkar Ghugardare', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. And which are the major countries you are exporting to?'}, {'chunk_id': 65, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"We're exporting to all these like regions we are growing, like Gulf, Oceania region or even Africa. Even Central America is now showing back on track because during COVID time, that was badly affected. But that also is going up. So all markets are good.\"}, {'chunk_id': 66, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Next question comes from the line of Ankit Kedia from PhillipCapital.'}, {'chunk_id': 67, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': '11% realization drop Y-o-Y and quarter-on-quarter. How much is due to price cut and how much is due to mix change on new -- you introduced INR105 chappals also in the market last quarter. So can you give us that impact of mix process price cut?'}, {'chunk_id': 68, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"The lowest-priced article that you're talking, that is very minimal. It has no -- any significance. It is just entry barrier kind of an article. But otherwise, whatever price cuts we could do on account of fall in our raw material prices that we have done, and that's it. No more price cut. They're competitive and optimistic. Since they're growing, we are getting our market share back.\"}, {'chunk_id': 69, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And sir, in this 11% realization drop, can you quantify how much is due to mix and how much is due to price cut?'}, {'chunk_id': 70, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Very complicated. We have 400 articles -- different articles, different pricing, different material consumption. So this is very difficult to quantify. I think article wise, everything are different.'}, {'chunk_id': 71, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Yes. Because more polymers are required in open footwear, like the EVA or Hawaii slippers. But in sports shoe, upper is a different material, bottom is different material. So you're right. In case of sports shoes, price cut was not in there. It was almost same.\"}, {'chunk_id': 72, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Understood. So the reading is the 75% open footwear, we would have taken a double-digit price cut, while in closed footwear, which is around 25% - 30% of our business, we would have not tinkered with the prices much.'}, {'chunk_id': 73, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'No, not much.'}, {'chunk_id': 74, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Understood. Sir, my second question is regarding promotions. We have seen higher promotional activity in the quarter in the market. Your competitors also in the month of January, February, March were very active by giving higher dealer commissions and even retailer commissions. So could you please elaborate, how was our promotion activity in the quarter? And going forward, how are you looking at your A&SP spend?'}, {'chunk_id': 75, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"If we maintain the A&SP spend -- in terms of schemes, we always -- we have -- like depends categories-to-category. Hawaii we have different types of schemes. And in shoe division, the reason we have different type of schemes. So seeing the demand, seeing the market scenario, seeing the pricing, we decide what kind of scheme we have to run. And we will see that in the competition also. So we don't benchmark exactly. We see what is our need and then we float the scheme. So we do not exceed -- the competition is giving more, let's give more. We have to analyze other situations also.\"}, {'chunk_id': 76, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. And what is the A&P target for next year? And how much is it for this year, if you can quantify?'}, {'chunk_id': 77, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So like if you talk about A&SP, we do around 8% to 9%, and we are maintaining this from last two, three years, and we will try to maintain a similar pattern in this coming year also. So this includes advertisement and promotion.'}, {'chunk_id': 78, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And how much would be pure advertising?'}, {'chunk_id': 79, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Roughly around 4.5%, 4%.'}, {'chunk_id': 80, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Understood, sir. And sir, if you can just share one of your competitors in sports shoes is going very aggressive in EBOs. While if I look at your EBO count for last four years, has been pretty much flat at 390-odd EBOs. Why haven't you expanded EBOs in last four years? What is the risk you see in EBO expansion, which has -- while COVID years were also there in two years, but still, the expansion has not been compared to the market where we are seeing competitors expand EBOs. So if you can just talk a bit on that?\"}, {'chunk_id': 81, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No. You're right that the last two years, we didn't expand. We wanted to make it a little more efficient because we have to control our bottom line also and our articles, 75% are open our products. Share of our retail outlet in the total scheme of things is around 8%.\"}, {'chunk_id': 82, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Right. And is it fair to assume the margins in EBOs would be just near double digit and lower than the company average?'}, {'chunk_id': 83, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Yes. It's lower than company average, but I think the high single-digit margin, we are in that category.\"}, {'chunk_id': 84, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Understood, sir. Thank you so much and all the best, sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 85, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Manish Poddar from Motilal Oswal AMC. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 86, 'speaker': 'Manish Poddar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thanks for taking the call. So primarily three questions. One is, can you help me with primary and secondary numbers for this quarter?'}, {'chunk_id': 87, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Can you repeat again, can't hear you?\"}, {'chunk_id': 88, 'speaker': 'Manish Poddar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Primary and secondary numbers? Because you are saying that Q1 is still soft, But your volume numbers, when I look at 5.2 versus 4.2 of last year or 4.1 of this quarter -- last quarter, they seem to be doing decent . So I'm just trying to understand what am I missing?\"}, {'chunk_id': 89, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"I think, it's volume growth. Are you referring the number which you have mentioned in investor presentation.\"}, {'chunk_id': 90, 'speaker': 'Manish Poddar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes. Volume growth.'}, {'chunk_id': 91, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"We sold more open footwear in this quarter and lot of demand was there. So that's why these numbers are very high as compared to earlier quarters.\"}, {'chunk_id': 92, 'speaker': 'Manish Poddar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Okay.

And sir, my next question is with regards to, again, on the pricing part, while we see prior to the increase in the GST from 5% to 12% in products below INR1,000. And even if you compare it versus the pre-GST era, I think the taxation on this segment is now higher. So how does it -- how is it impacting demand at the lower end?

Let us wait-and-see how the things pan out.'}, {'chunk_id': 165, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Sir, my question was more not on the near term, but more broader and a long-term question. Is this a business wherein we can target EBITDA margins also near 20%?

So if we try to take the margins a bit higher, is there a case where you can attract more competition at that price points?\"}, {'chunk_id': 166, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Definitely we have to be very cautious on this count. We should not just in an ambition to raise EBITDA and then we start losing market share. So -- but we have to always watch all the conditions, how is the market scenario, how is our efficiency level, then we have to improve our back-end efficiencies and become more competitive. At the same time, EBITDA can also improve in that case. So always you have to be agile and watchful of all those conditions to improve the things.Gaurav Jogani: So if I summarize or understand it better, I think you would like to keep your margin in a tight range wherein you remain competitive versus the competitors, but at the same time, also drive profitability for the business.'}, {'chunk_id': 167, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes.'}, {'chunk_id': 168, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Next question comes from the line of Sachee Trivedi from Trident Capital.'}, {'chunk_id': 169, 'speaker': 'Sachee Trivedi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"My question is actually, I would say, my first point is almost a complaint, if you will.

Or do you fix both and then work on the cost?'}, {'chunk_id': 176, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"So we have to be mindful of both the things.

Sir, how should we look at Relaxo, right? I mean, pricing has been an issue for us in the past as well in FY '18, '19, and one of the larger peers entered into our territory and started undercutting on prices. We couldn't increase our ASP. Like if I look at '17, '18 and '19, the ASPs were largely practiced at around about INR125. And in '23, again, we saw similar things. So should we consider Relaxo as more of a volume plus operating leverage story and less of a branding story?

Is that understanding correct?\"}, {'chunk_id': 179, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No, no. Last year, it was a totally different scenario because of the raw material volatility, not a because of any brand problem because when the material that we've got at INR 300, and then it falls to INR 150 and local market was able to get at lower.

Thank you for joining the Q2 and H1 FY2023 earnings call of Relaxo Footwears Limited. We have already uploaded our earnings press release and presentation at the exchanges, and we hope you have got an opportunity to review them. Before we open the floor for question-and-answer session, I would like to take you through an overview of the numbers of Q2 and H1 FY2023. During Q2 FY2023, the company reported total revenue of Rs.670 Crore as compared to Rs.714 Crore in Q2 FY2022, registering a decline of 6.3% year-on-year. The performance remained subdued mainly on account of fall in volumes in Q2 FY2023 in the categories serving the masses. With consumer facing inflationary pressures affecting affordability, there has been a shift in consumer habits as they moved towards cheaper alternative at the cost of quality. This prompted the company to take an aggressive price correction in September 2022 to remain competitive in the current market. This price specialization approach has been welcomed by distributor and customer, which would help us clear high-cost inventory in the coming quarter and ultimately improve our volume number going ahead. EBITDA in Q2 FY2023 was at Rs.59 Crore as compared to Rs.117 Crore in Q2 FY2022. This degrowth in EBITDA was mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices. EBITDA margin during the Q2 FY2023 was at 8.9% and declined by 748 bps year-on-year. The profit after tax was at Rs.22 Crore in Q2 FY2023 as compared to Rs.69 Crore in Q2 FY2022. Moving to our H1 FY2023 performance, the total revenue was at Rs.1,337 Crores and grew by 10.3% year-on-year as compared to Rs.1,212 Crore in H1 FY2022. EBITDA was at Rs.146 Crores from Rs.183 Crore in H1 FY2022. The company reported a profit after tax of Rs.61 Crore in H1 FY2023 as compared to Rs.100 Crore in H1 FY2022. Strong fundamentals complemented by wide distribution reach, strong brand recall and better sourcing capability we are optimistic about overcoming this tough phase and focus on delivery, steady revenue growth in both domestic and export going forward. Thank you. Now we can open the floor for questions.'}, {'chunk_id': 5, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question and answer session. Anyone who wishes to ask the question may please press star and 1 on the attached telephone. If you wish to put yourself in question que you may press star and 2. The first question is from the line of Gaurav Jogani from Axis Capital. Please go ahead'}, {'chunk_id': 6, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you for the opportunity Sir, my first question is with regards to the sharp volume decline that we have seen, and you have also mentioned that you have taken aggressive price cut in September 2022. So, one, if you can highlight what is the quantum of the price cut that you have taken, and how much of that has impacted the initial volumes? Because we understand that your distributors would have destocked initially, and because of which also there will be some volume impact.'}, {'chunk_id': 7, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, I am Ramesh Kumar Dua this side. Just in the background, I want to tell you a few things. The main cause of our price increase in the past 1.5 year had been some of the raw material polymers like EVA, PVC, polyethylene, they have started gradually rising and kept on rising to an extent, the thing which we were getting at Rs.120 a kg, reached Rs.300 kg, and then this started falling also, and it came down to Rs.160. So, in such kind of volatile situation, where our company has to maintain a long supply chain because materials are imported, it has to be at least 6 months‚Äô supply chain. So when the things arise, then it is beneficial for the entire trade company and our customers. But when there is sudden fall, which historically, at least I have never witnessed. Such a fall from Rs.300, to become Rs.160, and local market becoming cheaper than the international market at which we got. Our way of pricing the products have been based on our costing. But now during this period, when the local raw material prices became lower than our cost prices, the local industry or other people who are always sourcing the material from local sources, they became competitive and also the affordability of the mass segment, that has been affected because of inflation all around. As a result, for our mass customers, they started shifting to cheaper products, never mind the quality, whether it lasts 2 months or 3 months, they are not bothered. They just want to while away this difficult period, which they are facing for inflation. So when the prices were rising gradually, we are forced to revise the prices upward. But when the raw material started falling or it became cheaper to the competition, they reacted very fast. But as far as our company is concerned, which has a long supply chain, we took our own time. Meanwhile, because of unaffordability of our article to the masses, they went for cheaper alternative. So that started affecting our sales. Now in the month of September, we have made some price correction so that we are competitive in the market. Never mind, it will affect our bottom line, but to be in the market, have volume sales, that is a kind of cautious call to maintain our market share in the market. So that has been the reason. Otherwise, if I want to tell you the gravity of the thing, EVA polymer, we are consuming around 1,000 tonnes per month that is in a year, 12,000 tonnes, and the material of this, which was Rs.120 kg, last year it became average Rs.210, you can see a difference of Rs.100 kg, 12,000 tonne, Rs.120 Crores for single material, and even in another 6 months, this year also, our average has been Rs.240. So this is the magnitude, which we say average is Rs.240, but in local it became Rs.160, so they became more competitive. We took this aggressive step to be competitive, but in the coming months, all those things are not still stabilized, the Rs.160, which was coming to local now it has become Rs.200. So things are very volatile. We are keeping an eye in the market, and we will keep on taking timely corrections, keeping in view of how the other markets are reacting. That is it.'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Just to follow up on this one. So one, what is the magnitude of price cut that you have taken in September, and second thing, now because you are saying the local markets, again, that price has become Rs.200 per kg, and you might be having some inventory because of this. So now does that place you better versus the competition because you have some earlier inventory also with you?'}, {'chunk_id': 9, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes. Generally, our supply chain is around 6 months. The price correction has been around 15% to 20%. Our main segment that is affected is Hawaii and EVA segment. Other PU related footwear and Sparx shoe that is not affected. That has grown and it is okay also. It is only where EVA polymer is being consumed, they are in our Bahamas brand, and Relaxo and also Flite EVA category. There, our company has suffered because of this volatility. Even earlier, we were able to predict what will be the price of this material next year. But now our purchase department is not able to tell in guarantee what is going to be the price next quarter, such is the kind of volatility and instability. Under such volatile chaotic conditions, things have become quite challenging, and now we are keeping a close watch on the market and taking timely corrections, not based on our costing, but based on market conditions.'}, {'chunk_id': 10, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure sir, One last question from my end. What dichotomy we are seeing in terms of consumption in footwear at least that the premium and the mid-premium segment continues to grow well. You have highlighted that for you the Sparx and the sports shoes are relatively unimpacted. So according to you what is driving this difference? Wherein the sports shoes and the higher segment is growing, but people are not able to afford being the lower end of the segment.'}, {'chunk_id': 11, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Well, you all know richer are becoming richer and poorer are becoming poorer. This mass segment, his affordability has been affected, and that was quite a big share of our business.'}, {'chunk_id': 12, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Plus rural market in India, they are really suffering, if you read the Economic Times today also even Hindustan Lever is taking heat because of a lot of inflation in rural market. So the purchasing power in rural market is more affected than urban India.'}, {'chunk_id': 13, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. Sir, anything that you are doing in terms to cater to the demand that is shifting towards, I would say, to the premium and the mid-premium segment. So what is the company‚Äôs efforts on the same and how the company is looking to make more from it?\\\\'}, {'chunk_id': 14, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'We are focusing on our other categories, which are doing well.'}, {'chunk_id': 15, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'There has been some disturbance, we will be reconnecting again.

Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 18, 'speaker': 'Bharat Chhoda', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thanks for the opportunity Sir, Our cost of goods sales for per pair has been around Rs.60, Rs.65 over the last few quarters or so, and then probably this quarter, it has gone to Rs.88 per pair. So in the ensuing quarters, do you see like in Q3, Q4, that could come down to between Rs.75, Rs.80 or even lesser than that? Do you see that possibility?'}, {'chunk_id': 19, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes. Although raw material conditions are quite volatile, but we have a long supply chain, and we have a lot of goods purchased at higher prices, Last year also we are carrying inventory. But in this quarter, that is October, November, December, all that old inventory will be flushed out, and January, February, March, there, our cost of production will be definitely low, and things will be better.'}, {'chunk_id': 20, 'speaker': 'Bharat Chhoda', 'role': 'Company Official (Executive)', 'text': 'So probably from Q4 onwards, we would see normal gross margin things returning?'}, {'chunk_id': 21, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Since we started improving, topline will start improving, but at the same time, we have to keep ourselves competitive, relevant as per the market. We have to be very watchful, what is the affordability of the mass segment. Accordingly, we have to take corrective action timely.'}, {'chunk_id': 22, 'speaker': 'Bharat Chhoda', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So this high-cost inventory will be there for one more quarter at least?'}, {'chunk_id': 23, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes, at least. This quarter, it will be flushed out, by November or maybe December by all means.'}, {'chunk_id': 24, 'speaker': 'Bharat Chhoda', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Ok, Our raw material prices, what was the peak level that was there and from a percentage increase on a Y-o-Y basis, and from there, how much it has fallen down right now? If you could give a benchmark on that.'}, {'chunk_id': 25, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, it was Rs.120, it gone up to Rs.300, now it has become Rs.200. That is the kind of volatility you can understand, consuming 1,000 tonnes a month, you can understand the volatility and the affect.'}, {'chunk_id': 26, 'speaker': 'Bharat Chhoda', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'How is this higher-end segment doing like you said it is growth in that.

Otherwise, our factory will not be able to run. Local source, availability is only meant for small manufactures. If we go to the market, the rate will get out of control because of the local market, because our 1,000 tonnes, nobody can match. So we have to maintain this supply chain so that there is no disruption in the manufacturing process.

So there is a factor, the Hawaii factor, the EVA factor, what we are doing in Hawaiian and Flite that has degrown a lot. So whatever gains we are getting from shoes division is getting nullified.

First is on your sportswear. So, if my understanding is correct, out of about 20% of closed footwear, about 50% is sports and athleisure, right, which should be ballpark around Rs.250-odd Crores. So just wanted to understand, what are our plans there? A few of the recently listed companies and in fact, overall market, also a lot of smaller players have rapidly grown in the recent past. So, what are our plans here? we recently also added capacity in the sportswear. So how do we plan to grow this business over the next probably 3 years, if you could share your insights.'}, {'chunk_id': 76, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So, this sports shoe segment this divided into online sale and distributor sales, the channel sale. So, in both channels, we are seeing a good demand coming from the market, and that is why we have added the capacity there only. And we are adding more designs every year, like this year also we have added a lot of designs and we are giving a lot of trust to a placement of products in the market. So, we are expecting a good growth coming from these Sparx segments specially sports shoes.'}, {'chunk_id': 77, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Ok, So, could you share what is our plan over 3 years, if you could share some number what growth we can expect here given that there are players who have reached up to Rs.50-100 Crores revenue, and we certainly have a very deep distribution reach. So we should be able to use our existing distribution reach or sportswear requires a different reach and therefore, it should be a very slow growth business.'}, {'chunk_id': 78, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'No, this would not be a slow growth. We are growing at 30%, and we will continue to grow more than 30% year-on-year in this category, and the demand will come from both channels, online, offline both.'}, {'chunk_id': 79, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And is the number that I shared about Rs.250-odd Crores from the sportswear number correct? Or is my understanding...'}, {'chunk_id': 80, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'That is only typical sport shoes, which we did last year, Rs.250 Crores. So definitely it will grow from here.'}, {'chunk_id': 81, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Understood, and just second question is on the inventory situation. So given the fact that you have taken price cuts, you would obviously have a lot of inventory yet in the system, which is at a higher price point. So by when do you expect that inventory to get unwind, and then you should only have one price point or lower price point inventory available in the market.'}, {'chunk_id': 82, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': 'At company level, by December end, we will be able to clear almost all the inventory of old prices, but it will go through the retail and that will take 1 to 2 months more at the retail level. So it is a long supply chain. Company can get over quickly. But at retail and distributor level, it takes time, maybe 2 to 3 months more, so by March it will be everywhere new prices.'}, {'chunk_id': 83, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So, so far, whatever is the current price point, we should be able to normalize our inventory by probably March unless seeing some more volatility.'}, {'chunk_id': 84, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (Executive)', 'text': 'From company point of view, by this December, it will be clear.'}, {'chunk_id': 85, 'speaker': 'Aliasgar Shakir', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it this is very helpful Sir. Thank you so much. I will come back in the queue.'}, {'chunk_id': 86, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. We will move on to the next question that is from the line of Ankit Kedia from Phillip Capital. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 87, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, the price cuts are 15% to 20%, which you alluded in the open footwear category, is it in line with the raw material price deflation what we have seen, or the price cuts are more towards volume protection and not towards RM fall which you have seen from average perspective?'}, {'chunk_id': 88, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Price revision has been taken keeping a view of the local market conditions, affordability of the consumer and what is the competitive environment. To be competitive, we have brought these prices, and we have to always remain competitive in the market. That is what we have done.'}, {'chunk_id': 89, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Is it fair to assume that the price cut is more than the RM deflation, which we have seen in the market and hence, the gross margins could bleed actually because of this?'}, {'chunk_id': 90, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'No, this gross margin under pressure until December. It will start looking up in January onwards. But one thing I must tell you, the raw material situation is very volatile. We cannot even predict in January, February, March at what rate we will be buying. Based on whatever we have in supply chain and what we are making current buying arrangements from international suppliers, we are able to tell today.'}, {'chunk_id': 91, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Sir, let me put it the other way. So if the RM increases, we will continue to maintain our prices to gain volumes and not increase our prices further...'}, {'chunk_id': 92, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'That is a very strategic view point you are raising. You need to watch the market condition at the same time. Whatever is the market environment accordingly, we have to respond.'}, {'chunk_id': 93, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. Sir, my next question is on your sports footwear. So from the current MBO retail network, how much is for the close sports footwear, if you can share that, and over the next 2 years, because we are expanding capacity, how much is coming predominantly for online? Are we going to have a differential product like some of our competitors have for online, where we will focus more or it is going to be fungible between online, offline as the demand comes in?'}, {'chunk_id': 94, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Currently, we have same portfolio, but going forward, we will have different portfolio, especially SMUs for e-commerce and different products for the offline because we want to control the price, there is sometimes a lot of price war.

So we are going to change our strategy and making SMUs for online channel.'}, {'chunk_id': 95, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And sir, how many exclusive MBOs do we have for Sparx out of the 60,000 retailer network which we have?'}, {'chunk_id': 96, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'You are talking about wholesale or you talking about our own retail outlets?'}, {'chunk_id': 97, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'How much for wholesale, sir?'}, {'chunk_id': 98, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Wholesale, what we have, we are going currently 50,000 to 60,000 outlets. We have a data of 90,000 outlets.

What is the potential for Sparx for these outlets you feel given that open footwear will obviously be more, and how do you plan to target the South and West market for Sparx?'}, {'chunk_id': 100, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sparx does well in South and West. Already, we are doing good in the South and West.

Last year was around 12% of your revenues. What is the target given that the strategy is going to be more focused on online over the next 2 years, predominantly for the closed footwear contribution from online?'}, {'chunk_id': 102, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'See 12% is all brands put together.

Our share of export is around 4%.'}, {'chunk_id': 163, 'speaker': 'Anush Mokashi', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Opening up of maybe Sparx EBO.'}, {'chunk_id': 164, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO)', 'text': 'No, no. Internationally, we are not opening any EBOs. It is only domestic that we have exclusive for our brand outlets.'}, {'chunk_id': 165, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'But as our test marketing, what we are doing is, we are opening the stores into countries through our distributors to check the consumer taste there of our styles that we are promoting there that we are doing in few countries, and eventually, we will take a call how to go about it.'}, {'chunk_id': 166, 'speaker': 'Anush Mokashi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'I am assuming that EBOs margins at the distributor level are much high here than the MBOs or the retail outlets we have. Am I right in that condition?'}, {'chunk_id': 167, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'You mean multi-brand outlets or exclusive brand outlets, what do you say. How many number of you want to know?'}, {'chunk_id': 168, 'speaker': 'Anush Mokashi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'No. My question is around the margins. Basically, the margins which we get at the EBO level the distributor margin. Those are much higher in EBOs compared to the MBOs.'}, {'chunk_id': 169, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Definitely, margins are higher, but because you have to do so many expenses, rent and staff and so many things, so MBO is a different model, they have their own shop or just proprietor running the shop. So we give margin around 30% to the MBO and then they pass on some discount and they are earning around 25% - 30%. So that is more profitable but in case of EBO, definitely, there are margins are high, but expenses are also high.'}, {'chunk_id': 170, 'speaker': 'Anush Mokashi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay thank you so much sir, that is it from my side.'}, {'chunk_id': 171, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you.

First is, what is the total Capex for FY2024 and 2025?'}, {'chunk_id': 173, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'FY2024, FY2025, see we have been spending around Rs.80 to Rs. 100 Crore every year. So this year, FY2023, we have planned around Rs.140 Crores. So 2024 and 2025, it should be between Rs.80 to Rs. 100 Crore. It is an ongoing Capex, we always have to expand.'}, {'chunk_id': 174, 'speaker': 'Manish Poddar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And when you say you have not lost market share, how do you get a gauge on that?'}, {'chunk_id': 175, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sorry, we have not lost the market share, next, what you are saying.'}, {'chunk_id': 176, 'speaker': 'Manish Poddar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'You mentioned on the call that you have not lost market share. So I am just trying to understand how we get a gauge on that. You track shelf space, how do you get a sense of that.'}, {'chunk_id': 177, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'We have our sales offices. We have more than 300 sales officers visiting 50,000 outlets. So we keep a track of the primary sales, the secondary sale, the shelf space and what we are seeing the volume degrowth in Hawaii and EVA category. So that clearly mentioned that the shelf has been taken by unorganized players.'}, {'chunk_id': 178, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'But now we are getting back.'}, {'chunk_id': 179, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Now we are getting back, yes, definitely, after taking price correction.'}, {'chunk_id': 180, 'speaker': 'Manish Poddar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And just one last one. So is the demand environment at the bottom of the pyramid really that bad because when you look at a couple of data points, let us say, price increase taken by mobile players or you look at a couple of online guys in apparel, doing very well, some of that thing does not add up.'}, {'chunk_id': 181, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes. Because if you just read today newspaper Economics Times, clearly mentioned Rural India Big Pressure by Hindustan Lever, ITC, all. Rural India is really under pressure there because of inflationary pressure, and urban India is doing really well that you can easily see that. All urban brands, urban consumption is there in mobiles or in automobiles. But rural India, we are seeing a sharp decline in consumption also.'}, {'chunk_id': 182, 'speaker': 'Manish Poddar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Fair enough. Thank you.'}, {'chunk_id': 183, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhishek, an investor. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 184, 'speaker': 'Abhishek', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you for the opportunity I have a couple of questions. My first question is around, as you mentioned, the opening remark, right, that the EVA prices in the domestic markets are around Rs.200 per kg. So does it mean that now there is an even playing ground for us and other unorganized players?'}, {'chunk_id': 185, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, now it is better because now after taking price correction, we are at same level because we are buying at Rs.200 and they are also buying at Rs.200.'}, {'chunk_id': 186, 'speaker': 'Abhishek', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Right, and are there any further price cuts expected by us?'}, {'chunk_id': 187, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'No, I do not think so.'}, {'chunk_id': 188, 'speaker': 'Abhishek', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So my next question would be around the Sparx brand. So is there any competition from the organized sector from other listed or other large players in the sector, in Sparx brand?'}, {'chunk_id': 189, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, there are a lot of organized players, and there is a competition, no doubt about it. But we have a different market, different product portfolio and the athleisure demand overall is increasing for every brand because the consumer trend is shifting to a fitness, lifestyle, health. So demand of athleisure footwear is going up, for the industry itself is going up.'}, {'chunk_id': 190, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'That is why we are doubling the capacity.'}, {'chunk_id': 191, 'speaker': 'Abhishek', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it, and my last question would be on the contribution of Sparx from its open footwear and from close footwear. Is the open footwear competition that is sandals much higher compared to sports shoes?'}, {'chunk_id': 192, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'No, the competition is in both levels, sandals, and shoes. It is not that competition is less in shoes or sandals. So it is an athleisure category. So it is a growing category and market is growing.'}, {'chunk_id': 193, 'speaker': 'Abhishek', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it. Thank you.'}, {'chunk_id': 194, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tejash Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 195, 'speaker': 'Tejash Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Just one question from my side. Usually, we have seen in a category where there is a large participation by unorganized sector. Inflationary period is always beneficiary for organized players because of the scale, ability to manage supply chain volatility and in procurement, planning, production. Understandably, they should have an upper hand versus unorganized players. So in our case, it did not play out like that. So just wanted to understand, was it different in our case or there were some more headwinds or unprecedented headwinds which did not allow us to capitalize on this opportunity?'}, {'chunk_id': 196, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So as long as we were rising, we were in a better position. It is only because there was a decline of the price of our main material from Rs.300 to Rs.160. If you consume 1,000 tonnes a month, at that time, local market availability of the material came down at Rs.160 - Rs.180. But we have a long supply chain, which we are buying, and our average price was Rs.240 for the year. So it was just in this 3 - or 4-month period when they became advantageous because we have a long supply chain thereby supply short supply chain. But this happens once in a life that prices go down and they became advantageous. It is very rare phenomena. It is just a matter of time. Otherwise, we cannot be dependent at all on local sources. Our factory will come to a halt. To have uninterrupted, no disruption, manufacturing process, we have to maintain this sufficient inventory in the pipeline. During the lockdown period, even there was so much of scarcity of material and even getting containers to ship the material became a challenge. So that is why we took little abundant precaution and added a little more stocking also just to avoid any manufacturing disruption.'}, {'chunk_id': 197, 'speaker': 'Tejash Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And sir, just expanding that point, what percentage of competition would be importing either raw material or finished goods from China, especially from unorganized?'}, {'chunk_id': 198, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'I cannot comment on that. I can tell you about ourselves.'}, {'chunk_id': 199, 'speaker': 'Tejash Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'No, I was asking about unorganized, not organized, but anyways, thanks.'}, {'chunk_id': 200, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Unorganized, their figures are not at all available to anybody. I do not know even they pay GST to the government. I cannot say anything.'}, {'chunk_id': 201, 'speaker': 'Tejash Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Fair point sir.

Ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the financial year 2021-22. We have already shared our earnings press release and result presentation. Hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q4 FY22 Financial Performance followed by full year FY22 Financial Performance. In Q4 FY22 Relaxo booked operating revenue of 698 crores as compared to Rs. 748 crores in the corresponding period of previous year. Revenue during the quarter was affected due to disruption caused by Omicron variant of COVID, GST rate hike from 5% to 12% w.e.f. January ‚Äò22 on footwear priced below Rs. 1,000 and subdued demand due to high inflation. EBITDA during the quarter is at Rs. 111 crores as compared to Rs. 163 crores in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter is 15.9%. EBITDA margin decreased mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices and extra support provided to trade towards GST rate differential on inventory. Our profit after tax is Rs. 63 crores for the quarter as compared to Rs. 102 crores in the corresponding period of previous year. For FY2022 our revenues stood at Rs. 2,653 crores as compared to the Rs. 2,359 crores which is a growth of 12% year-on-year. The growth in revenue is achieved mainly due to calibrated price hike taken during the year to mitigate impact of high raw material prices. EBITDA is at Rs. 416 crores as compared to Rs. 495 crores in the previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the year is 15.7%. The decline in EBITDA margin is mainly on account of increase in raw material prices and normalization of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in FY22 as compared to FY21. Our profit after tax is Rs. 233 crores as compared to Rs. 292 crores during the previous year. During FY2022 we generated cash of Rs. 140 crores from operation and spent Rs. 140 crores in CAPEX. At the end of March 31st, 2022, we have 394 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 7% of our FY22 revenue. Export crossed Rs. 100 crores mark and is picking up with opening of market and its contribution is more than 4% of revenue of FY2022. Going forward we are cautious about our continual extraordinary inflation and remain cautiously optimistic on the basis of strong recovery across category, especially in the high-value closed footwear category after opening up of offices, schools, and colleges. We believe that we are well positioned in the footwear marketplace by providing the right price value equation to our customer while making sure our product remains affordable and accessible. We remain committed to all our stakeholders by creating a strong foundation for the future which can provide a sustainable and profitable growth for the long term. Thank you. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.'}, {'chunk_id': 6, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Tejas Shah with Spark Capital.'}, {'chunk_id': 7, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Just will start with a couple of basic questions. If you can help us to understand the realization split increase which has happened between price increase and premiumization if any happened during the year and during the quarter?'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Price increase, because this full year was lot of inflation, raw material prices went up. Price increase was in the range of 25% across all the categories, in few categories more and few categories less. This is majorly due to the price increase and product mix because closed footwear was sold much more as compared to FY21. That mix also happened in this year. Overall increase majorly is due to price increase.'}, {'chunk_id': 9, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'This 25% price increase would be at customer level, because of GST increase as well but that would not have totally reflected in our numbers, right?'}, {'chunk_id': 10, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No, it's a mix of raw material and GST. GST came only in January ‚Äò22 that was the last increase which we took but overall, from start of the year from May onwards raw material prices were going up so we took three to-four price increase in full year.\"}, {'chunk_id': 11, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Second, though initial period yet, but almost 4-5 months have passed by after GST increase has happened. What is the initial feedback in terms of customer and both channel whether they have absorbed this price hike easily or it will take some more time for demand and channels to settle down on this?'}, {'chunk_id': 12, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"So, it's been 4 months you are right. What we are seeing is in first 2-3 months there was a pressure because it was new for the trade. So, there was a lot of resistance. People were talking about taking this price back from 12 to 5, they were giving lot of representation to the government but now it is settled. The rates have been settled. Post that there is definitely a pressure because of inflation, consumer sentiments are still not so great and whatever the pass on off price what we have done, or the industry has done its taking time for the consumer as well as for the trade to take it.\"}, {'chunk_id': 13, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"The last one, based on the recent channel checks which has been done on the sector it has seen that there's a huge traction in online channel for closed footwear especially the sports footwear or athleisure footwear. So, have we seen any such traction in our number a) what was our exposure to online channel for the full year as a company and also within the Sparx brand in particular?\"}, {'chunk_id': 14, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, Sparx brand has done very well in e-commerce platform and we can see the growth rate was more than 40% in e-commerce platform.

My first question is with regards to the RM inflation as you have highlighted. Is the bulk of the RM inflation now done or do we need to take further price increases to mitigate the RM inflation that we have seen?'}, {'chunk_id': 20, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Raw material situation continues to remain unpredictable. You cannot say for guarantee that everything is settled. Always we are getting news of different kinds, sometimes packing material, chemicals, polymers. So, things are not stable as yet, we can‚Äôt say confidently things are stabilized as far the raw material situation is concerned. But we have to be watchful of it and accordingly we have to see market dynamics also and accordingly keep on taking appropriate action.'}, {'chunk_id': 21, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"To put the other way round if assuming whatever the RM prices are today, does it cover whatever the price increases that we have taken as on today, RM price do we cover it or do we need to still take further pricing action to cover the impact? Because the impact on margin is huge as can be seen from the results. Still do we need to take more price increases to even cover today's RM inflation.\"}, {'chunk_id': 22, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No, we have to wait and see all these things. Ultimately our goal at the moment is to focus on our market share in the market and keeping in view the article that we are in, which are meant for masses, lower rank of society. So that's very important that we will be keeping strict vigil on it and accordingly take appropriate actions at appropriate time.\"}, {'chunk_id': 23, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'My next question is with regards to your volume if we see this particular year, so the volume this particular year has even seen a decline if we compare versus FY20. While I do agree that there was some impact during the first quarter due to Omicron and even this quarter was impacted. But how do you see the volume trajectory going ahead in the light of the sharp RM inflation that we are seeing given our target customer is very price sensitive?'}, {'chunk_id': 24, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Last year if you remember in May we had this Corona wave where everything was shut down and followed by January also we had a small Omicron variant coming in. So definitely there has been a pressure on volume in term, because last to last year the open footwear was selling a lot because people were at home and there was extraordinary sales happening on last-to-last year. So, to sustain that was a challenge. Going forward the consumer sentiments are still not so buoyant. We feel I think after maybe Quarter 1 the things will come back but very difficult to say right now because of unpredictable supply chain things are not settled, raw material prices are not settled but we are hoping that Quarter 2 onwards we can see some recovery.'}, {'chunk_id': 25, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'One last question from my end is regarding the sportswear segment. The sportswear or so to say the casual footwear segment has been seeing very good traction as such. In this light we have seen lately, one of our competitors getting listed on the exchange and they have been showing smart growth in Q4 as well. In that light if you see what is our action towards the sportswear segment what are we doing to address that?'}, {'chunk_id': 26, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, we have three brands. Basically, for them it is athleisure brand what we hear. That is one third of our business. We are also seeing a good growth rate in athleisure and sports category. We are growing in line with the industry.'}, {'chunk_id': 27, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Company Official (Executive)', 'text': \"Anything that you're seeing, because on a general market check suggests that they are higher on the market share percentage-wise given that they are very dominant in that segment. Anything that we are doing in terms of product launches or expanding our reach on the online that you can highlight that we are increasing our presence there?\"}, {'chunk_id': 28, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"Definitely we are taking some steps. I think it's like for example we are increasing some A&SP spends on e-com and having new tie-ups with different channels also.

Can you just provide a brief view on that?'}, {'chunk_id': 31, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official (CFO)', 'text': 'This has been because there was a pressure upon sale and price also. Our inventory has increased abnormally more than expected and there are two reasons for the inventory increase, one is the pressure upon sale and also the prices because your cost of goods and everything has increased.

Inventory is the major reason for working capital disturbance in this year and there are two reasons, one there was pressure upon the sale and second because the cost of goods has also increased, even raw material also. We were carrying little more inventory just to be more cautious about the future price increase, so inventory has increased in the balance sheet. That is visible also. Second, there is a slight increase in some debtors. So, these are the two reasons the working capital is under pressure. Ramesh Kumar Dua Material locked up includes raw material also.'}, {'chunk_id': 34, 'speaker': 'Bharat Chhoda', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'We have seen this the realization being significantly higher at this level do you see we would see we would see an impact on the volumes going ahead and probably also what is the margin we should work with?

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the Q2 FY 2022. We have already shared our earnings press release and results presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q2 FY 2022 financial performance, followed by H1 FY 2022 financial performance. In Q2 FY 2022, Relaxo booked operating revenue of Rs. 714 crores as compared to Rs. 576 crores which is a growth of 24% year-on-year. EBITDA during the quarter stood at Rs. 117 crores as compared to Rs. 127 crores during the corresponding period of previous year. EBITDA decreased mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices, enhancement of marketing, brand promotion and other administrative expenses as compared to corresponding period of last year wherein raw material prices were extremely low. Other Income stood at Rs. 7 crores as compared to Rs. 5 crores in the corresponding period in the previous year. The increase is mainly due to higher interest income on investment during the quarter. Our profit after tax was Rs. 69 crores for the quarter as compared to Rs. 75 crores during the corresponding period of previous year. For the first half of FY 2022 we registered revenue of Rs. 1,212 crores as compared to Rs. 939 crores in the corresponding period in the previous year. EBITDA was at Rs. 183 crores as compared to Rs. 184 crores in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our profit after tax was Rs. 100 crores for the first half of FY 2022 as compared to Rs. 99 crores during the corresponding period of the previous year. At the end of September 30\", 2021, we have 400 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 6% to our Hl FY 2022 revenues. Exports are also picking up with opening of market and contributing more than 3.5% of revenue in H1 FY 2022. Going forward we are cautious about the inflationary trend in the raw material prices which has further intensified and has reached elevated levels impacting gross margins. However, we are taking all possible measures to mitigate its impact on margins including timely price increase. We will continue our effort to grow our presence in untapped and under penetrated market and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions.

It has been a very sharp increase and despite that we have seen a margin pressure in the quarter. So, first of all, how should we think about this price increase and consumer reaction to that. And how should we think about margins based on this price increase going forward? Ramesh Kumar Dua : The way things are, raw material prices are still on the increase. They are yet to stabilize. All that was hoped that in the third quarter things will stabilize. But now still things are volatile, and we are keeping a watch on it on day-day-basis and accordingly we are revising our prices. But at the same time, naturally when there is unprecedented increase, there is always a consumer resistance. So, we are cautious while increasing our prices. So, we have been able to absorb part of the raw material increase in cost. But we have to also be mindful of the competition and take steps appropriately accordingly. We are taking our price increases accordingly from time to time. Already, twice we have increased the price in the past, and third is also being planned and we will keep on acting the way things are turning out to be.'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'How much price increase have we taken so far in the year?'}, {'chunk_id': 9, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Investor', 'text': 'Around 15%.'}, {'chunk_id': 10, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'This is weighted average across portfolio.'}, {'chunk_id': 11, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes.'}, {'chunk_id': 12, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And you spoke about inflation still being high, so have we taken again after reporting this quarter number, have taken in October-November so far?'}, {'chunk_id': 13, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'In October yes, we have taken some price increase.'}, {'chunk_id': 14, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And are the price increases taken so far protect our margin at current level or we need to take further interventions to bring back to 2-3 years levels?'}, {'chunk_id': 15, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Because raw material prices have not stabilized so far.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the financial year 2020-2021. We have already shared our earnings press release and results presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q4 FY 2021 financial performance, followed by full year FY 2021 Financial Performance. In Q4 FY 2021, Relaxo booked operating revenue of Rs. 748 crores, which is a growth of 38% year-on-year. The strong revenue growth was partially due to low base of Q4 FY 2020, as we know sales was impacted in Q4 of last year due to lockdown in the month of March last year. EBITDA during the quarter was Rs. 163 crores which was a strong growth of 69% as compared to the corresponding period of previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 21.8% vis- √†-vis EBITDA margin of 17.8% in Q4 FY 2020. Our profit after tax was Rs. 102 crores for the quarter, up by 97% year-on-year with a PAT margin of 13.7%. For FY 2021, our revenue declined marginally by 2% to Rs. 2,359 crores with EBITDA margin of 21%. Our PAT of Rs. 292 crores in FY 2021, with a margin of 12.4% grew by 29% year-on-year, mainly due to product mix and saving in selling and administrative expenses. During FY 2021, we generated a cash of Rs. 513 crores from operations and spent Rs. 142 crores in CAPEX and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of March 2021, we have 398 exclusive brand outlets which contribute around 7% of total revenue. Export is holding its ground and contributing around 4% of revenue. During the ongoing crisis, we are undertaking all necessary measures to ensure safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We continue to support and provide assistance to our distributor and customers. Due to lockdown in various parts of India, overall demand for footwear is subdued right now. However, we believe that demand for footwears will bounce back whenever these restrictions are lifted. The second wave of COVID-19 India is more severe and continues to impact lives and livelihood. We stand with all those affected and are dedicated toward protecting and supporting our employees, partners and communities in the face of this unfolding crisis. Relaxo, remains committed towards its stakeholder by creating a sustainable, profitable and growing business. The company enjoys comfortable liquidity position with zero net debt and continues to provide assistance to its distributors and vendors. Despite the uncertainty related to the extent and length of the fresh wave, we believe that company is well placed to emerge stronger in the post COVID- 19 world. We remain committed to give the best experience and value for money to our customer and creating long-term value for our shareholders. We can now open the floor for question. Thank you very much.'}, {'chunk_id': 5, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Nihal Jham from Edelweiss. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 6, 'speaker': 'Nihal Jham', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, a couple of questions from my side. And I am taking from our last interaction, at that point in time, obviously, you mentioned that given the trend in raw material prices, you expected longer term margins to sustain at around 18%. But we have obviously ended the year at a much higher number. First, if you could comment, what is it that you expect going forward? Then after which I can come to my next question.'}, {'chunk_id': 7, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'This year, that is 2021, the margins have been more because we have been saving on account of sales and promotion expenses, travel expenses and some professional expenses and the raw material price also have been benign. Some efficiencies we worked at back end in our plants, that was the main reason for achievement of more than expected EBITDA level.'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'Nihal Jham', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, as a trend, is that in the coming year we expect most of these expenses would normalize, especially on the advertising part?'}, {'chunk_id': 9, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"We have to see it from time to time how things are. Presently the way second wave has come up, traveling will remain restricted. But brand building is something you can't avoid, that we have to go on. So, this year our strategy is that we have to build our brand in the long-term interest. So, this year, compared to last year, our expenditure on brand building will be more, this is what I want to say.\"}, {'chunk_id': 10, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Sorry, sir, we are not able to hear you.'}, {'chunk_id': 11, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'The expenditure on brand building this year will be more than it was last year, because for longer periods we cannot keep on saving on brand expenditure like advertisements.

That is what I wanted to say.'}, {'chunk_id': 12, 'speaker': 'Nihal Jham', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': \"That's very clear, sir. Thank you so much. One more question from my side. I just wanted to understand on the industry scenario at present. Will it be fair to say that given the disruption that has happened because of COVID, especially in a lot of our MBO channels there has been disruption of other brands which has helped us increase market share, would that be a right sense of what is happening on ground at this point in time?\"}, {'chunk_id': 13, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'The way things are very chaotic, unpredictable environment is prevailing. and nobody expected second COVID wave will be like that, we are now in the lockdown. And when the lockdown starts opening up, only then things will start working. Presently, three out of our eight plants are operating, and maybe 10% - 15% markets are open. So, business is largely affected. So, the way things open up, then we will be able to know how the things take shape. But as far as unorganized/organized is concerned, definitely we are in a better situation than unorganized players, that advantage we might have than others. And as far as our retail outlets are concerned, there our business is hardly 7% - 8%. So, last year also we suffered, a lot of retail outlets were closed. But because we are selling to a lot of multi- brand outlets around 50,000, which are through wholesalers and distributors . So that is our saving grace that we are able to have in our business. That is the way the things are. That advantage we will have this year also.'}, {'chunk_id': 14, 'speaker': 'Nihal Jham', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. Just a last question, what will be the share of ecommerce for the entire year?'}, {'chunk_id': 15, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Ecommerce, including modern trade is hardly 10%, I would say 8% rather. Some states are very low, after all we are selling not very high value item. Last year the ecommerce was closed for a lot of time, so shoes and all other, sale was less. Ultimately, our business was a little bit affected on ecommerce. But it is not a very big stake for us in ecommerce. Our articles are more on multi- brand outlets.'}, {'chunk_id': 16, 'speaker': 'Nihal Jham', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Absolutely. I was just trying to understand that this year, given the disruption, if there is a sizable increase in our share compared to last year, especially on the ecommerce side.'}, {'chunk_id': 17, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"No, you can't say that, because ultimately our articles are mostly priced around Rs. 125 to Rs. 150 - Rs. 200, these articles are unviable to be sold online. We generally sell to multi-brand outlets only.\"}, {'chunk_id': 18, 'speaker': 'Nihal Jham', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Absolutely. Because in the second quarter, when the disruption was at its peak, we had reached a 10% share, so I just wanted to check maybe there is a continuation of that once the open up happened after, say, September or October.'}, {'chunk_id': 19, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'You know, when things open, then online business is there. But we have seen, whole year how the things have panned out, but still we are sitting in lockdown. And ultimately, this year or last year, if the markets are chaotic, what we found is that when the people are indoors, more of the slippers have sold, this year also things may remain like this, where closed footwear will remain affected, and the online sale will also remain affected.'}, {'chunk_id': 20, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amnish Agarwal form Prabhudas Liladher. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 21, 'speaker': 'Amnish Agarwal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'I have a couple of questions. My first question is on the raw materials front. If you look at the gross margins, both on Y-o-Y as well as even on a Q-o-Q basis our gross margins were actually down, because in this quarter we are 56.8%, in the previous quarter they were 58.9%. So, how much is inflation in raw material currently? Because I understand that most of these petrochemical based imports have moved up even in the month of March, April and May. And secondly, how much price increase we have undertaken? And will we be able to sustain gross margins at the current levels? So, that is my question number one, first part of the margins. The second bit on the margin side, if you look last year, we have cut down on our overhead significantly. If I look at full year, they are down by nearly 400 bps, and you are yourself indicating that the ad spend will go up. Now, looking at this scenario that this year supply spend will comeback, raw materials are high, so what sort of outlook on margins would you like to get from here on? So, this is my first question on margins.'}, {'chunk_id': 22, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"The way things are, raw material prices definitely have gone up and are volatile. And this scenario we have faced in our life, a number of times. When the rubber was 100, then it was 250, these things do happen to any business cycle, and we have gone through it. So, what is our strategy? Every quarter, whatever price are, accordingly, we will then take our decision, keeping in view the market condition, price revision is done. So, whatever is required and is possible then we pass it on to our customers. So, this is what we have been doing. Raw material, naturally will always vary. But at the same time, we have to be watchful about competitive intensity in the market. And then you can't just immediately have the kind of knee-jerk reaction to prices and then after three months you may say, okay, now price have gone down so we reduce it. So, there has to be a kind of stability, from our best judgment we pass on the price compared to industry and looking at the competitive intensity, and accordingly take the decision and next quarter again we review the things. So, this is what we have been doing since ages, and this is what we tend to do in future also; Keep on watching the prices, keep on quarterly reviewing the market conditions and accordingly passing on. When margin is concerned, naturally this year things are different, so we have to watch the market conditions and take a decision. The way things are, gross margin may get impacted. But on the overall year basis, we have to wait and see, we can't say now. Accordingly, management also does a course correction in between also. Regarding branding, actually , that is the call we have taken, but then we keep on reviewing all these things. Market is very volatile, raw material or others wise. These lockdown exercises, nobody can say with guarantee how long lockdown will continue, how long COVID wave will continue, now there is a fear of COVID third way also. The way things are, nothing can be said with certainty. We have to see, keep on reviewing every quarter and take corrective action. That's it.\"}, {'chunk_id': 23, 'speaker': 'Amnish Agarwal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, how much pricing we would have undertaken in the past few months?'}, {'chunk_id': 24, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"Around 7% to 8% we have taken, but again, this price rise is depending upon article to article in the same category some article we have taken more than 10% or 15%. But again, we have to see which article can take how much price increase. Because we are in a kind of fashionable market, some articles don‚Äôt perform, some articles perform too much. And then we have to see what is the competition rate of similar articles. So, accordingly, article by article we have to review. We can't generally say, okay, 7% all around. So, we have to be very watchful on this, and have to decide article to article basis.\"}, {'chunk_id': 25, 'speaker': 'Amnish Agarwal', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. Sir, my second question is on the demand scenario. Because Relaxo caters more to the value for money segment in footwear, and last year rural India and small towns where was not impacted much by the first wave of COVID, but this time around the scenario seems to be different. So, what sort of an on the ground situation you are currently witnessing? And in your view, will it take longer for the demand to come back this time around, more so in the small towns and rural India?'}, {'chunk_id': 26, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Well, again, the things are, difficult to predict. But the ways things are and now COVID second wave is going down, things are improving, we think in a couple of months things will start improving and maybe back to normal. Many times, if there is a pent-up demand, immediately things start improving. I think June, July it will start, July will be the very good month to improve. Different states are taking different decisions. If the lockdown prevails and things will remain the way they are, it is a very difficult thing to predict., we will have to wait and see only; nobody can say with certainty what is going to happen. Because everybody is confused, to whom so ever we asked the question, how long things will continue the way things are, nobody can predict. You will have to wait and see.'}, {'chunk_id': 27, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you. Next question is from the line of Akhil Parekh from Elara Capital. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 28, 'speaker': 'Akhil Parekh', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'My first question is on the demand for closed footwear, like first few quarters of the year the demand was driven by open footwear. But the expectations were, as we move closer to the festive season and winter season, the demand will pick up. So, how has that been the case for demand in closed footwear for third quarter as well as in fourth quarter?'}, {'chunk_id': 29, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Demand of closed footwear did improve during festive season, the quarter three and quarter four, both. Before that, demand of closed footwear was fairly low, because it was all under a period of lockdown a few months we lost, people were also cautious in moving in the markets, people were more indoor, so shoe business was affected. But after this festival season, third quarter and fourth quarter have been quite satisfactory, as far as closed footwear is concerned.'}, {'chunk_id': 30, 'speaker': 'Akhil Parekh', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. And would it be fair to say the demand is now back to pre-COVID level for almost all the categories?'}, {'chunk_id': 31, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'This quarter four, yes, it was rather better. But now, again, this first quarter of this year we are sitting in lockdown, so what can be said about this time.'}, {'chunk_id': 32, 'speaker': 'Akhil Parekh', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. Just last question on the price hikes, you mentioned that on an average 7% to 8% price hike, so have we passed on the entire inflation in the raw material PU, EVA and even PVC, because the prices of raw metal have risen far more than 7%, 8% in last few quarters. So, should we expect more price hikes to happen during first two quarters of the year?'}, {'chunk_id': 33, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Well, we have to again review quarter by quarter, this is what we decided for this quarter, keeping in view the market conditions also. Now then we have to see how much raw material we have in stock. But at the same time, again, you have to look outward also and backward also, what is the supply chain; and outward, what is the market emerging competition scenario. Keeping that thing in view, we will review the things and then accordingly revise our prices, whatever whenever required, quarter by quarter.'}, {'chunk_id': 34, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. Next question is from the line of Tejash Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 35, 'speaker': 'Tejash Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Hope all of you are keeping well. Sir, sorry to stress this point more, but the first question pertains to our margin philosophy. And I will just give you some data before you answer the question. Sir, in last three years we have added roughly Rs. 400 crores of turnover, and we have added Rs. 200 crores of EBITDA there, Rs. 193 crores to be precise. Which roughly means that incremental turnover is actually coming at way higher EBITDA margin. And obviously, this year is abnormal, and you said that some of the costs were not there. But in a normal scenario, where would you like this business to operate at, at least for the near term? Will it be 17% range or that is not a part of the calculation at all, and it is an outcome based on the economic environment?'}, {'chunk_id': 36, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'It is very difficult to tell you what EBITDA margin will be, because things are totally unpredictable. The way we are sitting in the lockdown, we think it is difficult. Raw materials are expensive, overhead will just mount the way things are, we are trying to control the things. But let the things settle down then only quarter-by-quarter things will improve. Things are very unpredictable at the moment, totally volatile. Nobody can predict at this moment how the year is going to end. We only hope that this wave settles down, things start opening up. Then accordingly we will take our decisions, depending upon whether a price revision is required and what expenses to be saved for this year. So, we have to then take all these precautions. Definitely, if the things were under pressure, the margin will also be under pressure .'}, {'chunk_id': 37, 'speaker': 'Tejash Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, let me rephrase the question. So, let us assume hypothetically and then we hope so that situation normalizes very fast. As a business, are we comfortable operating at 20% plus margin without compromising on our competitive moat or our competitive power in the very competitive landscape that in any case we are operating in?'}, {'chunk_id': 38, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"We have to always watch competition also and act accordingly. Competition intensity is there, we have to keep things reasonable because of pricing, so that we don't want to lose market share. And then we have to spend money on brand building. So, all the things, keeping it together, sustaining 20% this year is going to be a real challenge, it is not possible the way things are now. But we have to wait quarter-by-quarter and see how the things open up.\"}, {'chunk_id': 39, 'speaker': 'Tejash Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Fair enough, this answers the question. The second question, you mentioned, and last time also you had mentioned, export presence in international market. So, any more firmer details on that? So, will it be anyways connected to PLI scheme that government is proposing on footwear as well?'}, {'chunk_id': 40, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': \"Let me answer the first part first. Actually, right now 4% of the company's revenue is contributed by export sales. And we are able to sustain these sales in last year also, because due to COVID all these Gulf countries and African countries have been affected a lot. But we have been able to achieve around 98% of the previous year. Since the government incentives we have been already in touch with the government authorities, whatever incentives we have been able to avail we are availing. And surely this impact of COVID is happening in this quarter as well because many countries have partial lockdowns or night curfew or complete lockdowns, so we are just having a ‚Äòwait and watch‚Äô and see how the things improve. But the good part is, we have been exporting in our own brand with our standard of quality which is really bringing confidence in the mind of consumer there. So, we are very confident we will come back revive the business soon, once the things settle down on COVID front.\"}, {'chunk_id': 41, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. We will move on to the next question that is on the line of Nikhil Chaudhary from Kriis Portfolio. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 42, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Chaudhary', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, I have just two questions. can you share the mix of closed footwear when we started the year and probably versus now when we end the year?'}, {'chunk_id': 43, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'No, we can average out. For the year, our closed footwear share is around 15%, 85% is open footwear.'}, {'chunk_id': 44, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Choudhary', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. And it is same like when we started the year and when we are ending the year, correct?'}, {'chunk_id': 45, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'In the start of the year, we were in lockdown, there was no share at all. April we lost, May also some part we lost. Definitely first quarter, second quarter share was low, it‚Äôs only after festival third and fourth quarter when things started opening up, when people started moving around, then only the closed footwear started improving. So, third and fourth quarter share of closed footwear was better, it improved, it came to better than last year. But first two quarters it was affected.'}, {'chunk_id': 46, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Choudhary', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. And sir, when we started the year, as in what I have meant is, like when we started, before the lockdown what is the usual share like? Because Campus is also coming up with a lot of closed varieties or SKUs in the closed footwear, and what our checks suggest is that Campus has become aggressive. So, just wanted a sense on how the competitive intensity is from Campus and how we are able to tackle it.'}, {'chunk_id': 47, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So, the competition is a very good thing for the company. The company always remains more active, and it is always good to have good competition, as a result the whole industry grows. And as far as your question, earlier than last year what was our share, it was 20% because first quarter and second quarter of the previous year were much better than what it was last year. So, this year because sale of slipper was much higher and growth was much more, so the ratio of open footwear went up across footwear. Because today also, throughout the year schools were closed so school shoe sale was not there, people were moving less outdoors so sale was affected, and other article also like tennis shoe, that is again closed footwear, because schools were closed so there were no sale. So, that has been one of the reasons. Even outdoor movement is less, sale of closed footwear goes down.'}, {'chunk_id': 48, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Choudhary', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it. Sir, all in all, we have not lost any market share, right?'}, {'chunk_id': 49, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'No, there is no loss of share. It is cyclical because of the market condition that things are happening like that.'}, {'chunk_id': 50, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Choudhary', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it. And sir, last thing, I just wanted to understand our strategy wherein the competitor is having nine distributors for, say, a set of area and we are just having one or two distributors, won‚Äôt it strain the balance sheet of one or two distributors in keeping all SKUs cut sizes? Just wanted a perspective, because I understand probably one or two distributors are not able to keep all the cut sizes, SKUs, and supply to our MBOs'}, {'chunk_id': 51, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'It is a matter of strategy. When you have too many distributors, they fight amongst themselves and then they say we don‚Äôt get margin. But if that competition will be too intensive among the distributors, then also they start losing interest in a brand. But when you give an allocated area to a distributor, then only he become more motivated to do that. And we have to protect that area suppose today you are my customer, I give you certain area, you do with your all-hard work and develop that area, and tomorrow suppose they put another distributor, so how you will feel like? After all, you have nurtured and developed the area, so it is your territory, your responsibility also. Today, if my salespeople go in the market and take orders, whom they will give order to out of the nine, if it is one I will give to that person only, the person who is responsible for that territory. So, that is the way we just operate, and we do allocation of area.'}, {'chunk_id': 52, 'speaker': 'Nikhil Choudhary', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Fair from the point of view of distributor, but just wanted a sense on how retailers are perceiving it. Because what happens is, I understand, I am completely agreeing with you that the distributor will definitely want to preserve his own interest as to he should not have the competition. But retailers will have lesser choices and then probably, from the point of view of retailers then it becomes a little hard in keeping our SKUs in all cut sizes, just getting a perspective,'}, {'chunk_id': 53, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'See, that I understand. When I find some distributor cannot handle all the range, then we may say, okay, you take these two brands, rest we give to another. But still, he will have some kind of a control or responsibility of that category. But from a retailer point of view, you are right, if he has more choices then he also plays between two distributors. Too much cutting of discount, then he expects too much of credit also from each other. That also is a very unhealthy position. As a company, we go to the retailer, we find what difficulties he is facing, then we sort out the way the things are. We don‚Äôt want a distributor should overcharge, and at the same time we don‚Äôt want the retailer should force him to cut too much discount and then both bleed later on. The retailers also many times pass too much discount to the consumer, that also we don‚Äôt want to see. When the retailer doesn‚Äôt turn, he looks back at the distributor, distributor looks at the company. We want there has to be some responsibility of the distributor, give him area, let him develop it. Whatever difficulty a retailer faces, then we are there to take care of it. This is the way we do things.'}, {'chunk_id': 54, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Dhaval Mehta from ASK Investment Managers. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 55, 'speaker': 'Dhaval Mehta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, my first question is, let us say, in FY 2021 what would have been the industry decline of the footwear category? And how the competitive landscape has changed in last one year?'}, {'chunk_id': 56, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, if you have noticed, during last year the formal segment, outdoor segment has declined, and the casual segment and work from home segment has increased the open footwear. So, party wear, fancy wear have declined in leather shoes, outdoor shoes, but the casual footwear, open footwear has increased.'}, {'chunk_id': 57, 'speaker': 'Dhaval Mehta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Correct. But even, let‚Äôs say, pre-pandemic open footwear used to be around 15% to 20% of the overall industry size, right, so if a large part of the industry has declined, the overall industry would have declined sharply, is my assessment correct?'}, {'chunk_id': 58, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'The major impact has come on leather shoes and outdoor shoes. So, that has declined tremendously and the gains are in open footwear.'}, {'chunk_id': 59, 'speaker': 'Dhaval Mehta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. And in terms of competitive landscape, be it from unorganized players or organized players, how it has changed in last one year?'}, {'chunk_id': 60, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'It‚Äôs a similar thing. The ASP has gone down, if you see as an industry the ASP has gone down because, again, the closed footwear being expensive have come down in share and the open footwear which are quite cheaper has gone up. So, similar thing with the un-organized also as well.'}, {'chunk_id': 61, 'speaker': 'Dhaval Mehta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. So, if, whatever the share of unorganized was pre-pandemic, is the share similar now or their overall share has come down of the overall pie?'}, {'chunk_id': 62, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'See, it is very difficult to measure, we don‚Äôt have a credible agency who can back the data that this is the percentage drop or this is the percentage increase. So, a guesstimate we can say, we have seen slight decrease.'}, {'chunk_id': 63, 'speaker': 'Dhaval Mehta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. My second question is, any fall out in terms of which brand of ours has done exceedingly well, be it Flite, Sparx or Relaxo? And in terms of geographies, which geography has seen healthy growth?'}, {'chunk_id': 64, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, if you see, in India, Maharashtra and Kerala had maximum lockdowns, so these two states in West and South were impacted more. But North India and East India were doing pretty well. This is last year scenario. But currently it‚Äôs all lockdown so difficult to say.'}, {'chunk_id': 65, 'speaker': 'Dhaval Mehta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Is the profitability same across all the geographies, sir?'}, {'chunk_id': 66, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, more or less it is same. It is only the freight which will be very less.'}, {'chunk_id': 67, 'speaker': 'Dhaval Mehta', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Okay. So, as most of our factories is in North, so if North does well then I believe the freight cost will be lower. So, that helps the margins?'}, {'chunk_id': 68, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Correct.'}, {'chunk_id': 69, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bhargav Buddhadev from Kotak Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 70, 'speaker': 'Bhargav Buddhadev', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, my first question is that you mentioned that the closed footwear demand has been impacted in FY 2021, but as we sort of enter second half of this fiscal, it seems likely that post vaccination things could slowly start coming back. So, in your experience, is it possible to broadly quantify what could be the extent of pent-up demand? And when I say quantify meaning would it be 1.5x of normal demand, 2x of normal demand in your opinion, broadly at the sector level?'}, {'chunk_id': 71, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Sir, it is very difficult to quantify that, we have to wait and see. We don‚Äôt even know to what extent our lockdown will reduce today. Things are so chaotic, so unpredictable we have to just move the way things are accordingly.'}, {'chunk_id': 72, 'speaker': 'Bhargav Buddhadev', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. But you think that there will be an element of pent-up demand for sure, right? Because this particular demand cannot get lost, the closed footwear demand.'}, {'chunk_id': 73, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'No, the pent-up demand will be there, but there is lot of fear in the minds of the people. Even when the lockdown is lifted I don‚Äôt think people will immediately start moving very freely. It will take some time, and then hopefully things will improve. This is what we think.'}, {'chunk_id': 74, 'speaker': 'Bhargav Buddhadev', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. Secondly sir, how are we prepared in the event there is a strong pent-up demand, are we carrying enough inventory to sort of meet that demand? Or can we push our factories to meet that demand? How are we prepared on that front?'}, {'chunk_id': 75, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'We have inventory also; at the same time we have production capacities also. So, we always have a cushion in our production capacity and we generally utilize 70%. So, we have cushion in our hands. Having inventory also doesn‚Äôt mean that we can have unlimited inventory, that also you have to take care. But the way things will pan out, accordingly we will take decisions and actions.'}, {'chunk_id': 76, 'speaker': 'Bhargav Buddhadev', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And lastly sir, at the company level, is it fair to say that the volume decline for the full year was in the range of 8% to 9% and across open wear and closed wear, in open wear we would have grown but in the closed footwear we would have seen significant volume decline, is that a fair assessment?'}, {'chunk_id': 77, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'No, last year actually our volume grew by around 7% because slipper sale was much more than the closed footwear, and that is low value segment. But because demand was much more of slippers, and our sale is only 2% less, so we could only make up because our slipper sale was more. So, actually volume was driven by around 7% growth.'}, {'chunk_id': 78, 'speaker': 'Bhargav Buddhadev', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. So, this realized increase of 7% was for the quarter and not for the full year?'}, {'chunk_id': 79, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Full year, we are talking about full year volume.'}, {'chunk_id': 80, 'speaker': 'Bhargav Buddhadev', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. So, for the full year you are saying volume growth was 7% and average realization would have been down because of increase somewhere?'}, {'chunk_id': 81, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Correct.'}, {'chunk_id': 82, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Girish Pai from Nirmal Bang. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 83, 'speaker': 'Girish Pai', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, I just want to understand, has there been an overconsumption situation in FY 2021 for open footwear, which could potentially mean softer demand in FY 2022?'}, {'chunk_id': 84, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'No, it doesn‚Äôt mean that. You would require slipper always, last year‚Äôs slipper cannot be used this year, after all there is limited life of a product. Anybody requires at least two slippers in a year, so that demand is going to remain. Once the things start opening up consumption will begin, consumption is there even today, even if you are indoor you still require slipper, you are not barefooted, consumption is still there. So, last year consumption cannot affect this year consumption, this is what I want to say.'}, {'chunk_id': 85, 'speaker': 'Girish Pai', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. Sir, had the second wave not happened, say, you were sitting in the month of February and looking out into FY 2022, what is the growth you would have probably looked at? I mean, what kind of numbers were you people looking at internally, assuming that second wave is not going to happen.'}, {'chunk_id': 86, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes, it would have been much better, because after all the whole month of May we have lost and in April also sales were affected. So, there is no point in just dreaming with those things, what could have happened. But now let us face what the reality is. The reality is, COVID wave is there and things are affected. We have to see now how our June pans out and how our second quarter pans out, that is what we have to see, that‚Äôs important.'}, {'chunk_id': 87, 'speaker': 'Girish Pai', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay. Lastly, sir at some point in time, I think three, four years back you had started this distribution restructuring where you focus more on exclusive distributors. Now, has the journey come to an end or are we still on this journey?'}, {'chunk_id': 88, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Sir, we are on the journey. Always you keep on improving the way of working. Today also we are doing the same thing and putting DMS system on those people, encouraging more-and-more people to become exclusively, our distributors selling our products. Then looking at their areas, territories how we can make them more responsible, how we can make them more efficient, how we can add retailers to them, more of a universe being created. So, it is a never-ending exercise. Even the best things can be made better, so we are always on it. And even today it is an ongoing exercise.'}, {'chunk_id': 89, 'speaker': 'Girish Pai', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, sir 650 to 700 distributors that you have, how many of them would be exclusive to you, sir?'}, {'chunk_id': 90, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Around 125. We are trying to encourage them more and more to convert to exclusive, so that journey will continue.'}, {'chunk_id': 91, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ankit Kedia from PhillipCapital. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 92, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, just wanted to understand the premiumization trend, how much was the premium product sold in the year, given that open footwear in the first half we saw a lot of premium Flite and others being sold, while closed footwear was more entry level products. So, by the end of the year how did that change happen? And from FY 2020 to FY 2021, has the premiumization overall increased significantly for us, which should have also aided some gross margins?'}, {'chunk_id': 93, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'No, last year was a tough year. Rather, we had to introduce a lot of value for money articles. So, as a result, our receipt per pair average price was lower, more slippers sold, although in the slipper segment we did add premium segments also. But ultimately, because shoe segment was not selling, and in shoe segment we had to introduce value-for-money shoes. So, overall, last year our average selling price came down, although volumes went up.'}, {'chunk_id': 94, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. Sir, my second question is regarding the school category, how big is the school category for us and how much is the inventory in the system for the schools? Because last year schools didn‚Äôt start, and this year with the uncertainty in the schools there could be a lot of pent-up demand from the school side. So, if you could just share on how does the school footwear industry work for us?'}, {'chunk_id': 95, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'It is a very small share in our scheme of things. Around 1% in share in our scheme of things, 1.5% or so, that‚Äôs all. And otherwise, basically schools are still closed so there is no shoe consumption at all.'}, {'chunk_id': 96, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Right. And sir, my last question is regarding the new BIS certification guidelines for footwear manufacturers, which is compulsory from 1st of July. How will that change the unorganized sector, because it will be very hard for them to get this certification? And do you see post this, in the second half, a good market share gain for organized footwear compared to unorganized footwear come in?'}, {'chunk_id': 97, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'First of all, on this guideline, our association is in regular talks with BIS and the government. And they are likely to postpone the implementation of this. And it will take time, because it is very confusing and even they are not clear. They used a word; I will just give one example, they say, rubber Hawai Chappal will attract to these things. But nobody makes rubber Hawai Chappal, what is the meaning of it, even they are not clear. When we asked them, what is rubber Hawai Chappal, they are not able to explain. Because these things they have picked up, it was from 20 years back what was happening. So, they are now in talks with us, our industry is talking to them, and they have understood the things. And accordingly, the likelihood is that implementation of these guidelines will be postponed for quite some time,.'}, {'chunk_id': 98, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. And sir, just one last thing, what was the absolute A&P spend last year? And if you could just share the absolute amount you are looking to spend in FY 2022? That would be very helpful, sir.'}, {'chunk_id': 99, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Approximately when we started it was 8% to 10%, it has come down to 5% to 7%.'}, {'chunk_id': 100, 'speaker': 'Ankit Kedia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, so in FY 2022 what are we looking at?'}, {'chunk_id': 101, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'We are thinking to 8% to 9%, an increase by 1% to 2%.'}, {'chunk_id': 102, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be taking the last question that is from the line of Mr. Gaurav Jogani from Axis Capital. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 103, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir, first question is with regards to, how much of the cost that we were able to save in FY 2021, how much of that can we sustain going ahead, I mean, in FY 2022?'}, {'chunk_id': 104, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CFO)', 'text': 'I would say 3% to 4% was the saving.'}, {'chunk_id': 105, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Of the overall savings side?'}, {'chunk_id': 106, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Of the that expenditure we are going to do this year.'}, {'chunk_id': 107, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So, basically, whatever we have been able to save last year, approximately 3% to 4% of which we can save this year, is that understanding correct?'}, {'chunk_id': 108, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO)', 'text': 'No, we have to again watch the market scenario and take decisions accordingly. We may have planned something, but ultimately you have to see the market scenario and decide whether it is a pricing, whether it is brand building, whether it is business promotion expenses, everything we have to see, it is a dynamic environment in which we are operating. You cannot just say it is writing on the wall, you do it like this. If the market dynamics change, we have to change our things also. So, that is a way things move, not that once we plan then we go, we have to see the environment. Environment is dynamic and we have to be flexible accordingly, that is what we will be acting on.'}, {'chunk_id': 109, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. And sir, my next question is with regards to the replacement cycle in the footwear industry. So, have you seen any changes over the past 5 to 10 years, earlier like people used to replace it every one year, two year, has that replacement cycle gone down on an overall basis, have you seen any trends as such?'}, {'chunk_id': 110, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'No, we can only say, earlier our per capita footwear consumption, guesstimate, 1.5 pair, now this guesstimate is 2 pairs per capita consumption. So, definitely what reflects consumption has gone up only because of this, many people are keeping more pairs than what they were keeping earlier. And as far as the poor man is concerned, those who wear slippers their consumption anytime is two, because one slipper lasts hardly six months, around six months, so he has to buy two pairs. But overall consumption of footwear has gone up because there is a variety, there is fashion. So, because of fashion itself people buy more than one pair, so that is the way consumption has increased.'}, {'chunk_id': 111, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Jogani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sure. Sir, last question from my end is, what is your CAPEX guidance for the year FY 2022, this coming year?'}, {'chunk_id': 112, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Around Rs. 140 crores to Rs. 145 crores is what we have planned.'}, {'chunk_id': 113, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the Q2FY21. We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q2 FY21 financial performance followed by H1FY21 financial performance. In Q2 FY21, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of Rs. 576 crore as compared to Rs. 622 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The drop in Revenue in Q2 is due to disruptions in economic activities caused by COVID-19 pandemic. Benign raw material prices and saving in administrative expenses led to an improvement in the EBITDA margin to 22% as against 16.8% in same quarter last year. Other income stood at Rs. 5 crore as compared to Rs. 2 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase is mainly on account of lease rent waiver/reduction of Rs. 2 crore agreed by lessors for our rented premises. Profit before tax was Rs. 100 crore for the quarter, up by 35% YoY with a PBT margin of 17.4%. Tax expenses for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2020 reflect changes made vide Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019 as adopted by the Company. Therefore, effective tax rate of quarter ended September 30, 2020 is not comparable with previous comparative period of September 30, 2019 as the Company had recognised the full impact of this change in Profit & Loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Profit after tax at Rs. 75 crore for the quarter, is up by 6% YoY with a PAT margin of 13.0%. For First half of FY 2021, we registered a revenue of Rs. 939 crore as compared to Rs. 1,270 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. EBITDA margins increased to 19.6% from 16.6% while PAT margins increased to 10.6% from 9.5% helped by favourable raw material prices. At the end of Sep 30th, 2020, we have 396 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 5% to our H1FY21 revenues. We have added net 6 new stores in this period. Exports are also picking up with opening of markets and are contributing around 4% of revenues. Going forward, we are cautious about the recent rising trend of raw material prices. We would continue our efforts to grow our presence in untapped and under- penetrated markets and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.'}, {'chunk_id': 6, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session.

I have three questions from my side. Firstly, I would like to know how was the demand scenario in Q2 and some color on the brand wise performance for us?'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'After the opening up, northern markets like Delhi was the first one to open up, so in Q2 we saw good demand picking up from the rural India. If you see brand wise, in the close footwear category majorly, there has been impact, but in open footwear we are getting a good demand for the Hawai brand, the Flite brand and the Bahamas. So, there is a good demand coming in open footwear. The second thing is work from home is also happening so there is more demand of open footwear and less for the closed shoes.'}, {'chunk_id': 9, 'speaker': 'Archana Gude', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'I was just going through your presentation and it suggests that we do not have presence through EBO in Southern India, your comment on this, is that intentional or how you intend to grow in the southern market? Ramesh Kumar Dua : Our purpose of EBO is a little different, strategic one. They are kind of display and exhibition of our products on the sale counters where our purpose is to capture the voice of the consumer and accordingly develop the new products so that we can understand the evolving need of the consumers about our products, the new products that we have launched, so currently we have around 400 outlets, but that is enough to understand the market. But if you want to go to south and west then it is a different thing commercially and then it must make economic sense. Today it is serving us marketing sense, where we understand the market, so from that point of view our objective is being well met with, so currently we do not have any plans to have such kind of outlets in other parts of the country.'}, {'chunk_id': 10, 'speaker': 'Archana Gude', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Some guidance on the raw material price trend and what kind of sustainable EBITDA margin you look forward let us say for FY2021 and 2022?'}, {'chunk_id': 11, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'So far, the raw material prices have been quite benign.

Given the category of footwear we are into, is it really easy to pass on any price hike if the raw material prices go up or how we look at the situation Sir?'}, {'chunk_id': 13, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'It depends upon what kind of price hike or what kind of prices have changed in the raw material, in case its nominal we do not want to intervene at that stage, but if there is major then we do review the costing of our products and we pass it, then it is not difficult. Any price hike based on genuine input increase is never questioned, it is only when we want to increase the price without any genuine reason then that is questionable, so that is our policy which we have been following in the entire history of Relaxo and we will continue to follow.'}, {'chunk_id': 14, 'speaker': 'Archana Gude', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you so much and all the best.'}, {'chunk_id': 15, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you.

Just continuing on the RM and the gross margin EBITDA, we have seen some of the best gross margin being posted in this quarter, I think much better than what we have reported in a very long history, so would be attributed to the crude price collapsing and that come into the benefit and is there any price hike? I think I remember you had about 2%, 3% price hike few months back, is it impacting? and just remind us from what kind of pricing action taken in the last six months or so if you have any and I think gross margins is also not understandable in the sense that the close footwear has been reasonably weak and probably it might have had some impact on the mix as well, so just wanted to understand the gross margins a bit and is there any one off in these numbers.'}, {'chunk_id': 17, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'The current situation we are in, things are changing a little. In the first six months, expenses were controlled, other administrative expenses we have controlled. Now when the market will start opening up then we will have to do more expenses on marketing sales promotion, brand building and all that. There was saving on travel expenses, and other administrative expenses also. The raw material also was quite comfortably priced. On the one hand prices of raw material will go up, well travel expenses, marketing and branding will go up as well. So, this what we have achieved in Q2 does not mean it is going to be the norm of the day. We have to be in the market in a competitive manner and accordingly have to take decisions. So as far as third or fourth quarter is concerned, our expenses will be more, so this kind of EBITDA margin should not be expected. Margin will be good, better, but it will be in a more reasonable manner. Let us wait how the raw material prices move which we will come to know in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, whenever some intervention of price increase is required then we will do, we have to review it every quarter, what are the prices of the raw material, other inputs, market scenario, competitiveness of the articles in the market and then we have to take a mature decision on that.'}, {'chunk_id': 18, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'If you could highlight was there any reduction and discounts etc., you gave in the last quarter given probably your competition may be facing supply side challenges?'}, {'chunk_id': 19, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': 'Definitely, in trade level also, the discounts offered were low and same thing happen in ATL and BTL expenditure also, it was not there in Q2.

The pipeline got empty in starting of Q2 and secondly, there is a high demand coming from the Bharat or rural India what we call, so demand for open footwear is quite high and definitely availability has improved from our factories and it has helped us to grow.

Capacity expansion also has to be done keeping in view the evolving or increasing demand of the different types of footwear.

It will be different paradigm, what kind of policy I follow. One thing is to buy the sole and upper , it will be different output.

We are continuing what we were doing before, so in COVID time we have not changed anything on the structure.'}, {'chunk_id': 143, 'speaker': 'Abhimanyu Takkar', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Where I am coming from is because in some of our channel checks we realized the availability of sizes is an issue at the MBO level wherein the distributors cannot stock all the sizes for all the retailers and hence we are losing out some customers due to this issue, like they are not getting all the sizes like earlier we had three, four distributors, so they could approach if A distributor does not have it, they will just approach B, just trying to figure it out like where we are trying to miss out on the channel changes?'}, {'chunk_id': 144, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'There are pros and cons with the policies. In some areas we have distributors where they have dedicated area, and it is one distributor giving to a retailer of that area.

But we asked the distributor to keep at least one month of inventory, because of having all the sizes and colors.'}, {'chunk_id': 155, 'speaker': 'Mithun Soni', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Then how do we help them improve their ROI, because that is a very important issue for our type of business where the number of SKUs are so high?'}, {'chunk_id': 156, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'We have installed DMS at all distributor points, so we get the stock data and secondary sales data. So whatever stocks are getting accumulated we come to know, and the billing is stopped for that. And the secondary, our salespeople are able to help him liquidate that stock which is stuck. So, we keep on monitoring what stock level distributor is carrying.'}, {'chunk_id': 157, 'speaker': 'Mithun Soni', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'My second question, for this quarter and six months, I am seeing our inventory and receivables has come down quite a lot, is it just because of the value of the inventory has come down or we have made some changes over there?'}, {'chunk_id': 158, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'As soon as we opened our plants in May, so there was a huge demand coming for open footwear. so whatever inventory, we were carrying forward in month of March got exhausted in just 15 to 20 days.

Over next two to three year period or over three year period, what is the sort of gross margins or EBITDA margins we should look at as a company aspiring so that is able to grow, invest and generate good amount of free cash?'}, {'chunk_id': 162, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'It is dependent upon market condition, demand conditions, what kind of scenario we are in, what kind of product acceptance is happening, what categories we are focusing on. Generally, if you see it has been around 16%. And this quarter because of some certain reasons it has gone up, if we can achieve 18%, it should be a good one.

Sir, I have two questions. Firstly, I want to know like what you see as a medium term target for the contribution of e-commerce to your total sales? You said that it is close to 10% currently.

Thanks a lot, and all the best.'}, {'chunk_id': 173, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashish Kanodia from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 174, 'speaker': 'Ashish Kanodia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thank you for the opportunity Sir. The first question is you talked about that once the market opened up there was significant pent up demand and production took time, so was there any loss of demand, did you fail to with any demand during Q2?'}, {'chunk_id': 175, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, definitely because the demand was quite high compared to stock what we were carrying, and it took time for factory to ramp up the production. So, at that time definitely we lost some sales.'}, {'chunk_id': 176, 'speaker': 'Ashish Kanodia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Fair to say that sales, had there been no loss of demand, the recovery which you would have see at least 5%, 7% better than what you reported?'}, {'chunk_id': 177, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Not that big.'}, {'chunk_id': 178, 'speaker': 'Ashish Kanodia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Secondly Sir, I understand that with marketing opening, most of your expenses would start going back to pre-COVID level. But have you looked at any cost rationalization in terms of any line items where you see structurally over the next three, four years, you will have lower cost versus what there was during the pre-COVID period and hence you will see some margin expansion from those particular line items?'}, {'chunk_id': 179, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Our marketing costs were low in the first quarter and second also, but third quarter it will now come back to pre-COVID level, we must continue building our brand. Now our people will also start traveling and expenses will start moving. And all these things will be there. As far as raw material expenses are concerned, they will depend upon how the international commodity behaves.'}, {'chunk_id': 180, 'speaker': 'Ashish Kanodia', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Is it fair to assume that all supply related and labour related challenges are now over and at least productions are almost back to pre-COVID level?'}, {'chunk_id': 181, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes, but in certain category like shoe there were no demand and now only demand has started improving, so there we are ramping up the things now and some manpower training is also going on to improve our production levels.'}, {'chunk_id': 182, 'speaker': 'Ashish Kanodia', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'That is all from my side. Thank you.'}, {'chunk_id': 183, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tejas Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 184, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Just a clarification first you mentioned that 20% of our footwear or 10% of our footwear is closed footwear. Which numbers one should refer to?'}, {'chunk_id': 185, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes. If you go on a volume term it will be around 10%, but value term, the value will be 20%.'}, {'chunk_id': 186, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay and when we see Sparx as a brand which is somewhere around 30% odd number as per our disclosure in the past, so is it a fair understanding then 20% by value from the 70% of out Sparx itself will be closed footwear?'}, {'chunk_id': 187, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'What I have told you it is regarding close footwear shoe, but in Sparx, there are also slippers. Not as a brand, I am talking as a category of the article, so sports shoes and sporty sandals that constitutes 20% of the turnover.'}, {'chunk_id': 188, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'I was just trying to deduce that Sparx will be somewhere around majority close footwear brands?'}, {'chunk_id': 189, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Yes, we have already been saying that it will be more than one third only now also.'}, {'chunk_id': 190, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay, second question, we have been hearing you for the last six, seven years and you have been pretty consistent on your margin commentary that you want to be competitive and you want to react to or rather respond to market situation rather than proactively chase margins. But during this journey we have expanded margins also from 12% to 17%, 18% now and obviously there was a one GST benefit also in between, but just wanted to understand the philosophy what do you benchmark your margins against, is it against the peer or margin is an outcome and you want to be competitive on pricing and you let the margin flow through whatever it comes to, so is it a goal seek in the pricing and margin is an outcome that is not under your control?'}, {'chunk_id': 191, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Focus is the consumer. First you have to understand what consumer is looking for and we have to first satisfy that need and consumer is looking for what price, so we have to make articles accordingly. And then everything goes back into it and if we are able to serve that need then we are able to expect good margins automatically out of it, but if you supply a fit product, you will not expect those margins at all. Rather sometime you have to sell article at a loss, so we have to always keep close contact, what is, you have already need as a consumer and set right to develop such products only, then only company will remain healthy and we will have better margins. So that lesson we are learning, and we are improving our portfolio accordingly.'}, {'chunk_id': 192, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Any A&P as a percentage or sale as a philosophy that we want to plow back every year?'}, {'chunk_id': 193, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'In A&P there are various components in it. One way it could be brand building, another could be giving discount, third could be giving gift. There is a whole plethora of things and this keeps on changing from quarter to quarter, time to time depending upon the market condition, company strategy and so many other factors. We cannot say if this philosophy will remain forever.'}, {'chunk_id': 194, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'I was asking from long term that 5% of sales or 6% of sales? Gaurav Dua : We should always see a market and keep on being flexible. We should not be married to one rigid philosophy; we must be acting on it.'}, {'chunk_id': 195, 'speaker': 'Tejas Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'This helps a lot.

Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 197, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Thanks for taking my question Sir. I had only one question just trying to understand results a little more at a granular level, we had a volume growth of 2% this quarter and sales decline of 7% and this gap is even despite lower cash discounts, lower trade spends and promotions and so on and just trying to understand why there is such a big gap between volume growth and sales decline, is it mix and if it is mix then it has actually benefitted our gross margins. so just a little more color on this number?'}, {'chunk_id': 198, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'It is a result of the mix, because closed articles have sold less and open articles are sold more and as in that open footwear or slippers and other things, where our one division Bahamas has grown much more. and they are premium category, so margin has been better in that category as a result thing have improved.'}, {'chunk_id': 199, 'speaker': 'Sameer Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Just a followup Sir, is it that the realization in closed footwear is higher, but on a margin level they are lower than open footwear is this understanding correct Sir?'}, {'chunk_id': 200, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': 'No, in every category we have different articles giving different margins whether it is Hawai category, Bahamas category, Flite category, Sparx category, in every category we have some premium articles and we have some value for money articles.

This impact was mainly due to nationwide lockdown. Due to adoption of IND AS 116, our rental expenses have reduced, and simultaneously depreciation and interest expenses have increased. The total impact of this new accounting standard on EBITDA is an increase of 45.23 cr. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 17.8% vs. EBITDA margin of 15% in Q4FY19. EBITDA margin of 17.8% for Q4FY20 stands at 15.7% without IND AS 116. As informed earlier our Company has chosen to exercise the option of lower tax rate of 25.168% as introduced by the Taxation Laws Ordinance 2019. Our Profit after tax was 52 cr for the quarter, down by 4.8% YoY with a PAT margin of 9.58%. For FY 2020, we registered a revenue of Rs 2410 cr, up by 5% with Gross margin of 56.88% and EBITDA margin of 17%. Favourable raw material prices and premiumization supported this growth. Our PAT of 226 cr in FY20 with a PAT margin of 9.4% grew by 29% YoY mainly due to cost control initiatives in manufacturing excellence and lower tax rates. During FY20, we generated a cash of 319 cr from operation and spent 208 cr in capex and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of 31st March, 2020, we have 390 exclusive brand outlets which contributed 8% to our FY20 revenues. We have added net 47 new stores in this period. Exports have expanded to new territories and is contributing 4% of revenues. During the ongoing crisis, we are undertaking all necessary measures to ensure safety and well-being of our employees and partners. The Company is strictly adhering to Government guidelines and have started operations in plants and offices. Prior to starting of operations, we have developed detailed SOP for safety of its employees. Proper equipment and sanitization material and mask has been provided at all locations. We continue to support and provide assistance to our dealers, distributors and customers. Due to nationwide lockdown overall demand for overall footwear is subdued but demand for open slipper segment has improved during the period. However due to restrictions in manufacturing operations fulfilment of such demand will be a challenge in short term. The Company has paid all long term debts in FY20 and its liquidity position is comfortable. Moreover, with start of business activities the liquidity position of the Company will continue to be comfortable. Relaxo has always been one of the most trusted brands and we believe that the Company is well placed to emerge stronger in post COVID world. We will continue to adopt strategic initiatives to strengthen our brand positioning, improve our product innovation and expansion into newer geographies. We can now open floor to questions.

Please go ahead.'}, {'chunk_id': 74, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Sir just to kind of ask the same question again which other participants have asked, so you touched almost 60% gross margin this quarter and I can see that crude prices have turned even more benign versus where let us say I would assume that you would keep an inventory of three, four months, so the inventories at which probably you will be procuring some of the polymers might have further fallen and that inventory probably will come in your consumption in the next three to four months, so should we expect that margins may improve and you have been indicating that you have been taking some price hikes also, so on a broader basis should this 60% gross margin that you have reported can actually further improve is that a fair expectation in FY2021?'}, {'chunk_id': 75, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'We have to watch market conditions, and see what kind of demand is coming up in different categories. With most of the new ways of SOP setting in the factory, lot of precaution are being taken, social distancing is being maintained, so production capacity of every unit is getting affected, so that is one way we will be raising our cost.

No, the question here is on the gross margin side, so I understand that will impact your operational cost and your employee cost, etc., but purely from a raw material standpoint let us see even if I look at from 1Q FY2020 to 4Q FY2020 you have improved from 54% to 60%, which in a way tells me that the raw material benefits come to you with a lag, but essentially even from a 4Q level the RM prices have declined and RM prices clearly will not have any impact of social distancing, etc., so that was my question is it that you hedge your inventory to some extent and hence some of the benefits may not be there in the future quarter or it is a usual three-month lag, which inventory is kind of get back into your gross margins?'}, {'chunk_id': 77, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Ritesh I think you are seeing only Q4, you have to see full year performance say gross margin in full year is around 57% so do not expect that 60% margin will be there in every quarter. In Q4 you can see there is increase in inventory, there is a less trading good so it has impacted and that is why it looks like there is a big jump in the margin, but that is not the case let us see the full year, which is around 57% that is sustainable again subject to so many things how manufacturing take shape and how material prices cost and then we will take the appropriate action so don‚Äôt get carried away with Q4 results, let us see the full year results and that will be a right indicator of the performance.'}, {'chunk_id': 78, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it Sir and just another thing I think you also talked about distribution incentives, etc., and this is general question in a market wise demand probably would be we are just seeing some bit of challenges do you think you will have to, how should we think about the discounting at the trade level would the discounting at the trade level would increase to clear the inventories or you may have to give better margins to distributors to push your products how does that happen and in that context how much is the pricing flexibility that you have as well would you have to roll back some of the price hikes you have done in the past?'}, {'chunk_id': 79, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'If you see the market, we have three brands one is Sparx, Flite and then Bahamas. In the open footwear there is a lot of demand coming up because in India migrants labour is going back, and due to lockdown people are sitting at home so demand of open footwear has gone up compared to the closed footwear. Three to six months from now on I think the demand can pickup for closed footwear.'}, {'chunk_id': 80, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Got it Sir and you told us that the ratio is two third to one third?'}, {'chunk_id': 81, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Yes, correct.'}, {'chunk_id': 82, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Okay Sir, thank you so much that is all.'}, {'chunk_id': 83, 'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Moderator', 'text': 'Thank you.

We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation, hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q2 FY20 financial performance followed by H1FY20 financial performance. In Q2 FY20, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of 622 cr up by 14.5% Year on Year. This revenue growth was the result of across-the-board performance with our Sparx and Flite, PU, Bahamas categories registering higher growth than other categories. Advantage of price increase took in past helped in the growth of this quarter. This quarter growth is a mix of value and volume growth. Benign raw material prices and increased premiumisation in some categories led to an improvement in the gross margin to 56% as against 53% in same quarter last year. Our employee expenses were 11.6% of revenue and almost similar to that of Q1FY20. The increase in absolute value of employee expenses in Q2FY20 as compared to corresponding period of last year is due to inflationary growth, creation of new position in sales and addition of manpower for our new production capacities. Due to adoption of IND AS 116, our rental expenses have reduced, and simultaneously depreciation and interest expenses have increased. The total impact of this new accounting standard on EBITDA is an increase of 11.8 cr. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 16.8% vs. EBITDA margin of 16.4% in Q1FY20 and 13.5% in Q2FY19. EBITDA margin of 16.8% for Q2FY20 stands at 15% without IND AS 116. Our Company has chosen to exercise the option of lower tax rate of 25.168% as introduced by the Taxation Laws Ordinance 2019. The full impact of this change has been recognized was 71 cr for the quarter, up by 79% YoY with a PAT margin of 11.3%. For First half of FY 2020, we registered a revenue of 1270 cr, up by 15% Gross margin of 55% and EBITDA margin of 16.6%. Favourable raw material prices in FY20 and volume & value mix supported this growth. Our PAT of 120 cr in H1FY20 with a PAT margin of 9.5% grew by 41% YoY. During H1 of FY20, we generated a cash of 160 cr from operation and spent 74 cr in capex and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of Sep 30th, 2019, we have 370 exclusive brand outlets which contributed 7% to our H1FY20 revenues. We have added net 27 new stores in this period. Exports have expanded to new territories and are contributing 4% of revenues. Going forward, we expect raw material prices to remain favourable. We would continue our efforts to grow our presence in untapped and under-penetrated markets and focus on strengthening our brands.

Highlights of this Q4, revenues increased by 16% to Rs. 636 Crores as compared to last year Rs. 550 Crores. This quarter growth has been mainly driven by increase in volume. EBITDA was at Rs. 95 Crores as against last year Rs. 98 Crores, so corresponding period of the previous year due to higher raw material prices, EBITDA margin in this quarter was 15%. Financial cost stood at Rs. 1.73 Crores. There is a decrease of 29% as compared to last year quarter. PAT was at Rs. 54 Crores as compared to last year quarter Rs. 53 Crores.

PAT was up by 9% to Rs. 175 Crores as against last year Rs. 161 Crores and margin at 7.6%. Overall our strong execution delivered a good quarter ended the fiscal on a strong note on growth in revenue mainly driven by volume. During the year, the margins were under pressure due to higher raw material prices; however, the impact was contained as we continued to focus on operational efficiency and streamlining product offering in the market. Way forward the imported raw material prices are softening and expected to continue benign. We will continue to adopt strategic initiative to capture expanding market opportunity in and explore geography and drive growth across all segments of our business. We remain committed to strengthening our brand with continuous innovation and accurately assessing customer preference and price positioning, creating, enduring value for our customer and shareholder is the key objective of the business.

Just wanted to get a sense from the gross margin side so on Y-o- Y basis I can see that your gross margins were still flat. Of course, there is the base effect to it, but so my question is that the gross margin side when can we start seeing an uptick in the gross margins? Secondly, on the other expenditure as well as on the employee cost side, we saw a significant jump of almost about 21% and almost 26% in the quarter. If you would just give us a sense to what drove the increase in the cost from the employee side and the other expenditure side?'}, {'chunk_id': 6, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Ritesh, gross margin was under pressure majorly due to raw material in this quarter, if you compare it with the last year quarter and the change in product mix was another reason of this change in the gross margin. Regarding employee cost, it is a normal inflation and some positions we created in the system that added to cost but overall it was due to new capacities and additions in the selling department that has increased the cost but it is majorly due to normal inflation.'}, {'chunk_id': 7, 'speaker': 'Ritesh Gupta', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'And Sir on the other expense side because even on a sequential basis, we saw meaningful jump in other expenses side, so what drove that and is there one-off or something in that?'}, {'chunk_id': 8, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Other expenses majorly include handling and processing charges which is labour cost on contractual basis.

Congratulation on good set of volumes, 14% volume growth is quite an achievable number, good number. Again, my question is as far as the strategy is concerned, what I understand as this year, this strategy was clearly driving volumes, sales growth came despite increase in the raw material prices, we were like, we chose growth as compared to the maintaining the margins and other things and now we are seeing that raw material prices have started softening, so can you give first and foremost some sense on what kind of softening we have seen and trend on the EVA pricing front that is part one of the question? Second part is, do we continue to still, as Mr. Dua said, that we have also taken certain price cuts also in this particular year despite raw material prices increasing, so are we going to increase prices, what is our outlook on that particular front?'}, {'chunk_id': 18, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'We have taken certain corrective measures to improve our profitability, so last year because of keeping ourselves competitive in the market, we had to take certain decisions, but now raw material prices are also softening and then at the same time we have taken certain price revision measures also.

I think last year was also normal, but we are seeing good decrease in PU material that is substantial part of our raw material and regarding EVA, we can see if dollar situation improves, then definitely some advantage will come, as we have seen that last year dollar was abnormally high, so EVA will be directly linked with the dollar and PU prices are decreasing with the base price as well as dollar advantage will come in the system.'}, {'chunk_id': 21, 'speaker': 'Sangeeta Tripathi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'What kind of a decline we have seen in the PU prices, which forms a substantial part of our raw material cost?'}, {'chunk_id': 22, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'This is you can say around 6%-8% prices would come down.'}, {'chunk_id': 23, 'speaker': 'Sangeeta Tripathi', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Going forward, are we looking for some amount of price increase because what I believe that in the overall portfolio still the prices would be little higher, definitely some stability is there as you rightly said, but still are we like looking at increasing the prices and one full year, one and half years we have not done any price increase, per se?'}, {'chunk_id': 24, 'speaker': 'Gaurav Dua', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'Already, we have taken some corrective measures in the last quarter around March end.

In one of the division, we took little competitive pricing that was in Hawaii division, others we have continued with the same.'}, {'chunk_id': 30, 'speaker': 'Manasvi Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'You maintained that the other two division Flite and Sparx are actually doing better than Relaxo in terms of overall growth?'}, {'chunk_id': 31, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Absolutely.

They are doing very good and better than Hawaii.'}, {'chunk_id': 32, 'speaker': 'Manasvi Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'So incrementally given that these are higher realization products both Flite and Sparx does mean that gross profits, actually gross margin is headed towards higher level going ahead, I am talking about it from longer term perspective, some 3-5 year perspective?'}, {'chunk_id': 33, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official (Executive)', 'text': 'When we talked about the Flite, there are two sub categories, one is Flite EVA and another one is the Flite PU. PU we are very aggressive and we took some call in that category that is why we are getting excellent market share. So, margin in this category is little lower than the other category, but that is the fastest growing category. This year material prices will be eased out in this category and it will fall with our company‚Äôs overall margin percentage, that is what we are expecting.'}, {'chunk_id': 34, 'speaker': 'Manasvi Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'The inventory days have actually risen during the year, any particular reason for this?'}, {'chunk_id': 35, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Certain raw material side, it was a conscious call to have more material, because to have an opportunistic buying you have to find certain things available at a better price so some inventory we have taken consciously.'}, {'chunk_id': 36, 'speaker': 'Manasvi Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'What is the capex guidance for FY2020 and FY2021?'}, {'chunk_id': 37, 'speaker': 'Sushil Batra', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Capex will be on same line, as we have been doing in the last four-five years, quantum will be around 80 Cr in 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.'}, {'chunk_id': 38, 'speaker': 'Manasvi Shah', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'That‚Äôs it from my side.

So, every year we try to acquire new customers in the new territories, so our efforts are still on for covering the west market for other two brands that is Bahamas and Flite and to spread Sparx in East India also.

You mentioned to one of the earlier questions that growing volumes in double-digit would be really tough. I had a question on this part. If I look at your volume growth over the last five odd years has been 10%-11% CAGR given that the market share that you have on a pan India basis is about 5%-6%. Why do you think it will be really tough to even do double-digit in terms of volume over the next few years?'}, {'chunk_id': 101, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official (CEO, CFO, Executive)', 'text': 'We are trying in all the markets, but after all double-digit is also quite a good growth, but as far as the value is concerned, definitely we can expect double digits growth.'}, {'chunk_id': 102, 'speaker': 'Aakash Manghani', 'role': 'Analyst', 'text': 'In your sense or over the last four to five years, what would have been the market growth?'}, {'chunk_id': 103, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Market has grown around 10% to 11% and we have grown better than market.

So, how does management think about pricing power with the respect to the Sparx brand as well as Flite and are there any product gaps that the management is looking to introduce and take this up a little higher may be in future, is there a plan to get into leather and so on, so if you could talk about something around ASPs and how you think about that whether the pricing power exists especially in the premium brand? Thanks.'}, {'chunk_id': 150, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Our all brands are meant for different segments.

So, this is the way the market is responding and accordingly we are launching the products, so our policy is to launch customers relevant products. Keep on studying the market and accordingly keep on launching the products.

If you could just highlight I missed that?'}, {'chunk_id': 152, 'speaker': 'Ramesh Kumar Dua', 'role': 'Company Official', 'text': 'Flite PU is basic kind of semi-formal footwears. EVA is the polymer, which is used to make this footwear and in case of PU, PU is the different polymer, which is used in that category. So on that basis, we call these categories. PU is a kind of semi-formal category and EVA is very casual kind of a full lightweight article which you can use in monsoon also and wash and wear kind of category meant for masses also and for medium scale also.

We have already uploaded the earnings press release and the investor presentation on the stock exchange as well as on our website. And we hope that you have had an opportunity to go through them. Before we begin the question and answer session, let me quickly go through some of the highlights of Q2 and H1 FY25 performance, beginning with Q2. Revenue from operations in Q2 FY25 was at INR 679 crores as compared to INR 715 crores in Q2 FY24, a decline of 5% year-on-year. This is mainly due to weak market demand during the quarter. Our EBITDA for the quarter was at INR 88 crores as compared to INR 92 crores in the corresponding quarter in the previous year. The company maintained its EBITDA margin at 12.9% during the quarter as compared to 12.8% in Q2 FY24, despite the subdued demand. PAT was at INR 37 crores as compared to INR 44 crores reported in Q2 FY24. PAT margin for Q2 FY25 stood at 5.4% as compared to 6.2% in Q2 FY24. Higher depreciation in the quarter has impacted the profitability of the company. Now moving to our H1 FY25 performance. In H1 FY25, we recorded a revenue of INR 1,428 crores, EBITDA was at INR 187 crores compared to INR 199 crores in the same period of last year. EBITDA margin was at 13.1% as compared to 13.7% in H1 FY24. PAT for H1 FY25 stood at INR 81 crores against INR 101 crores in H1 FY24. PAT margin was at 5.7% as compared to 6.9% in H1 FY24. The company has incurred a capex of INR 49 crores till 30th September '24. Our company continues to be net debt free and supported by positive cash flow from operations. Our company is in process of adding new distributors and focusing on to improve retail network through various initiatives. Further in line with our continued focus on cost efficiencies, we are performance in the future. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.\"},\n",

We have already uploaded the earnings press release and the investor presentation on the stock exchanges as well at our website and hope that you have had the opportunity to go through those. Before we begin the question-answer session, let me quickly go through the Q4 and FY24 performance, starting with Q4. During Q4FY24, we recorded revenue of Rs. 747 crores as compared to Rs. 765 crores in Q4FY23, reporting a marginal decline of 2.3% year-on-year on account of slight decline in volumes. EBITDA for the quarter was at Rs. 120 crores, up by 2% year-on-year from Rs. 118 crores in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. EBITDA margins were up marginally by 69 basis points and stood at 16.1% in Q4FY24 as against 15.4% in Q4FY23. PAT was at Rs. 61 crores as compared to Rs. 63 crores reported in Q4FY23. PAT margin for Q4FY24 remained flat at around 8.2%. Now coming on the full year FY24. We have achieved a moderate growth of 4.7% year-on-year from Rs. 2,783 crores in FY23 to Rs. 2,914 crores in FY24. This performance was largely driven by a significant uptick in open footwear volumes, a witness to the efficacy of our strategic initiatives to regain market share. EBITDA for the year was at Rs. 407 crores as against Rs. 336 crores in FY23, registering a growth of 21.1%. EBITDA margin was at 14%, improved by 188 basis points year-on-year as against 12.1% in FY23. Margins majorly benefited from the softening of raw material prices, which was partially offset by the increased fixed costs. PAT was at Rs. 200 crores in FY24 as compared to Rs. 154 crores in FY23, recording a significant growth of 29.8%. PAT margin was 6.9% during FY24 against 5.6% in FY23, improving by 133 basis points year-on-year. In FY24, the company incurred a total CapEx of Rs. 248 crores, including a purchase of 30-acre land parcel in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, worth Rs. 127 crores. We remain a net debt-free company recognition. We continue to explore new avenues and focus on other new channels and e- commerce platforms for growth. We are confident that our ongoing efforts will lead to favourable results for us in the future. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.'},\n",

EBITDA recorded a strong 54% Y-on-Y growth at Rs. 92 crores as against Rs. 59 crores in the corresponding quarter of last year. Softening of raw material prices and better operational efficiency due to economies of scale enabled us to enhance our EBITDA margin by 392 bps in this quarter. EBITDA margin was at 12.8% in Q2 FY24 as against 8.9% in Q2 FY23. PAT almost doubled in this quarter at Rs. 44 crores as against Rs. 22 crores in Q2 FY23. PAT margin stood at 6.2%, up 283 bps from 3.3% in Q2 FY23. In H1 FY24 we recorded a revenue of Rs. 1,454 crores vis-√†-vis Rs. 1,337 crores in H1 FY23, an increase of 9% year-on-year basis. EBITDA was at Rs. 199 crores from Rs. 146 crores in same period of last year, up by 37%. EBITDA margin was at 13.7% as compared to 10.9% in H1 FY23, an expansion of 280 bps. PAT for H1 FY24 at Rs. 101 crores against Rs. 61 crores in H1 FY23, grew by 65%. PAT margin was at 6.9% as compared to 4.6% in H1 FY23. The company incurred a CAPEX of Rs. 56 crores as on 31st September ‚Äô23. We remain a net debt-free Company with positive cash from operations.

The earning press release and the investor presentation have been uploaded on the stock exchange as well as at our website, and we hope you have had the chance to go through these. Before we begin the question and answer, I will quickly go through the Q4 and FY '23 performance starting with Q4. In Q4 FY '23, we recorded revenue of INR 765 crores as against INR 698 crores in Q4 FY '22, recording a growth of 10% year-on-year. On a Q-on-Q basis, the revenue increased by 12%. This is mainly due to volume growth across all categories. Our Q4 FY '23 EBITDA was at INR 118 crores, up by 6% year-on-year, from INR 111 crores in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. EBITDA margins were at 15.4% in Q4 FY '23 as against 15.9% in the corresponding quarter. On a Q-on-Q basis, EBITDA margins have grown substantially by 481 basis points due to the selling of low cost inventory along with costly old inventory. PAT at INR63 crores, on a sequential basis, that grew by 110% from INR30 crores in Q3 FY '23. PAT margin for Q4 FY '23 was 8.3%. Our price correction efforts during the last quarter have resulted in good momentum, and we have continued our market share recovery in all major segments during this quarter without relying much on discounts and offers. Now moving on to full year FY '23. Despite the challenging environment last year, our strong team responded effectively and our commitment to maintaining our high standard of excellence have made us successful. Revenue for FY '23 was at INR 2,783 crores, up by 5% year-on-year from INR 2,653 crores in FY '22. EBITDA was at INR 336 crores as against INR 416 crores in FY '22. EBITDA margin was at 12.1% as against 15.7% in FY '22. Margins were affected We are now a debt-free company with robust cash flow from operation due to our strong working capital management. During the year, the company incurred a capex of INR 174 crores. With the stabilization of raw fuel prices in Q4, we are currently experiencing strong demand and hold an optimistic view of the future. Our company is strategically positioned to take advantage of the opportunities within the industry, allowing us to further expand our market share. Our key strengths lie in our in-house manufacturing capabilities, the quality of our product, and the strong recall of our brand. We remain dedicated to upholding these strengths and will persistently strive to maintain their integrity. We are confident that our continued efforts will lead positive outcome for us in the time ahead. Thank you. Now we can open the floor for questions.\"},\n",

So is this true in multiple geographies? And do you think we would have lost any revenue because of that factor, if you could just quantify what could have been the impact of that in this quarter?

Like if I look at '17, '18 and '19, the ASPs were largely practiced at around about INR125. And in '23, again, we saw similar things.

We have already uploaded our earnings press release and presentation at the exchanges, and we hope you have got an opportunity to review them. Before we open the floor for question-and-answer session, I would like to take you through an overview of the numbers of Q2 and H1 FY2023. During Q2 FY2023, the company reported total revenue of Rs.670 Crore as compared to Rs.714 Crore in Q2 FY2022, registering a decline of 6.3% year-on-year. The performance remained subdued mainly on account of fall in volumes in Q2 FY2023 in the categories serving the masses. With consumer facing inflationary pressures affecting affordability, there has been a shift in consumer habits as they moved towards cheaper alternative at the cost of quality. This prompted the company to take an aggressive price correction in September 2022 to remain competitive in the current market. This price specialization approach has been welcomed by distributor and customer, which would help us clear high-cost inventory in the coming quarter and ultimately improve our volume number going ahead. EBITDA in Q2 FY2023 was at Rs.59 Crore as compared to Rs.117 Crore in Q2 FY2022. This degrowth in EBITDA was mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices. EBITDA margin during the Q2 FY2023 was at 8.9% and declined by 748 bps year-on-year. The profit after tax was at Rs.22 Crore in Q2 FY2023 as compared to Rs.69 Crore in Q2 FY2022. Moving to our H1 FY2023 performance, the total revenue was at Rs.1,337 Crores and grew by 10.3% year-on-year as compared to Rs.1,212 Crore in H1 FY2022. EBITDA was at Rs.146 Crores from Rs.183 Crore in H1 FY2022. The company reported a profit after tax of Rs.61 Crore in H1 FY2023 as compared to Rs.100 Crore in H1 FY2022. Strong fundamentals complemented by wide distribution reach, strong brand recall and better sourcing capability we are optimistic about overcoming this tough phase and focus on delivery, steady revenue growth in both domestic and export going forward. Thank you. Now we can open the floor for questions.'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Yes, I am Ramesh Kumar Dua this side. Just in the background, I want to tell you a few things. The main cause of our price increase in the past 1.5 year had been some of the raw material polymers like EVA, PVC, polyethylene, they have started gradually rising and kept on rising to an extent, the thing which we were getting at Rs.120 a kg, reached Rs.300 kg, and then this started falling also, and it came down to Rs.160. So, in such kind of volatile situation, where our company has to maintain a long supply chain because materials are imported, it has to be at least 6 months‚Äô supply chain. So when the things arise, then it is beneficial for the entire trade company and our customers. But when there is sudden fall, which historically, at least I have never witnessed. Such a fall from Rs.300, to become Rs.160, and local market becoming cheaper than the international market at which we got. Our way of pricing the products have been based on our costing. But now during this period, when the local raw material prices became lower than our cost prices, the local industry or other people who are always sourcing the material from local sources, they became competitive and also the affordability of the mass segment, that has been affected because of inflation all around. As a result, for our mass customers, they started shifting to cheaper products, never mind the quality, whether it lasts 2 months or 3 months, they are not bothered. They just want to while away this difficult period, which they are facing for inflation. So when the prices were rising gradually, we are forced to revise the prices upward. But when the raw material started falling or it became cheaper to the competition, they reacted very fast. But as far as our company is concerned, which has a long supply chain, we took our own time. Meanwhile, because of unaffordability of our article to the masses, they went for cheaper alternative. So that started affecting our sales. Now in the month of September, we have made some price correction so that we are competitive in the market. Never mind, it will affect our bottom line, but to be in the market, have volume sales, that is a kind of cautious call to maintain our market share in the market. So that has been the reason. Otherwise, if I want to tell you the gravity of the thing, EVA polymer, we are consuming around 1,000 tonnes per month that is in a year, 12,000 tonnes, and the material of this, which was Rs.120 kg, last year it became average Rs.210, you can see a difference of Rs.100 kg, 12,000 tonne, Rs.120 Crores for single material, and even in another 6 months, this year also, our average has been Rs.240. So this is the magnitude, which we say average is Rs.240, but in local it became Rs.160, so they became more competitive. We took this aggressive step to be competitive, but in the coming months, all those things are not still stabilized, the Rs.160, which was coming to local now it has become Rs.200. So things are very volatile. We are keeping an eye in the market, and we will keep on taking timely corrections, keeping in view of how the other markets are reacting. That is it.'},\n",

So one, what is the magnitude of price cut that you have taken in September, and second thing, now because you are saying the local markets, again, that price has become Rs.200 per kg, and you might be having some inventory because of this. So now does that place you better versus the competition because you have some earlier inventory also with you?'},\n",

Other PU related footwear and Sparx shoe that is not affected. That has grown and it is okay also. It is only where EVA polymer is being consumed, they are in our Bahamas brand, and Relaxo and also Flite EVA category. There, our company has suffered because of this volatility. Even earlier, we were able to predict what will be the price of this material next year. But now our purchase department is not able to tell in guarantee what is going to be the price next quarter, such is the kind of volatility and instability. Under such volatile chaotic conditions, things have become quite challenging, and now we are keeping a close watch on the market and taking timely corrections, not based on our costing, but based on market conditions.'},\n",

Inflationary period is always beneficiary for organized players because of the scale, ability to manage supply chain volatility and in procurement, planning, production. Understandably, they should have an upper hand versus unorganized players. So in our case, it did not play out like that.

If you consume 1,000 tonnes a month, at that time, local market availability of the material came down at Rs.160 - Rs.180. But we have a long supply chain, which we are buying, and our average price was Rs.240 for the year. So it was just in this 3 - or 4-month period when they became advantageous because we have a long supply chain thereby supply short supply chain. But this happens once in a life that prices go down and they became advantageous. It is very rare phenomena. It is just a matter of time. Otherwise, we cannot be dependent at all on local sources. Our factory will come to a halt. To have uninterrupted, no disruption, manufacturing process, we have to maintain this sufficient inventory in the pipeline. During the lockdown period, even there was so much of scarcity of material and even getting containers to ship the material became a challenge. So that is why we took little abundant precaution and added a little more stocking also just to avoid any manufacturing disruption.'},\n",

We have already shared our earnings press release and result presentation. Hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q4 FY22 Financial Performance followed by full year FY22 Financial Performance. In Q4 FY22 Relaxo booked operating revenue of 698 crores as compared to Rs. 748 crores in the corresponding period of previous year. Revenue during the quarter was affected due to disruption caused by Omicron variant of COVID, GST rate hike from 5% to 12% w.e.f. January ‚Äò22 on footwear priced below Rs. 1,000 and subdued demand due to high inflation. EBITDA during the quarter is at Rs. 111 crores as compared to Rs. 163 crores in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter is 15.9%. EBITDA margin decreased mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices and extra support provided to trade towards GST rate differential on inventory. Our profit after tax is Rs. 63 crores for the quarter as compared to Rs. 102 crores in the corresponding period of previous year. For FY2022 our revenues stood at Rs. 2,653 crores as compared to the Rs. 2,359 crores which is a growth of 12% year-on-year. The growth in revenue is achieved mainly due to calibrated price hike taken during the year to mitigate impact of high raw material prices. EBITDA is at Rs. 416 crores as compared to Rs. 495 crores in the previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the year is 15.7%. The decline in EBITDA margin is mainly on account of increase in raw material prices and normalization of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in FY22 as compared to FY21. Our profit after tax is Rs. 233 crores as compared to Rs. 292 crores during the previous year. During FY2022 we generated cash of Rs. 140 crores from operation and spent Rs. 140 crores in CAPEX. At the end of March 31st, 2022, we have 394 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 7% of our FY22 revenue. Export crossed Rs. 100 crores mark and is picking up with opening of market and its contribution is more than 4% of revenue of FY2022. Going forward we are cautious about our continual extraordinary inflation and remain cautiously optimistic on the basis of strong recovery across category, especially in the high-value closed footwear category after opening up of offices, schools, and colleges. We believe that we are well positioned in the footwear marketplace by providing the right price value equation to our customer while making sure our product remains affordable and accessible. We remain committed to all our stakeholders by creating a strong foundation for the future which can provide a sustainable and profitable growth for the long term. Thank you. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.'},\n",

We have already shared our earnings press release and results presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q2 FY 2022 financial performance, followed by H1 FY 2022 financial performance. In Q2 FY 2022, Relaxo booked operating revenue of Rs. 714 crores as compared to Rs. 576 crores which is a growth of 24% year-on-year. EBITDA during the quarter stood at Rs. 117 crores as compared to Rs. 127 crores during the corresponding period of previous year. EBITDA decreased mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices, enhancement of marketing, brand promotion and other administrative expenses as compared to corresponding period of last year wherein raw material prices were extremely low. Other Income stood at Rs. 7 crores as compared to Rs. 5 crores in the corresponding period in the previous year. The increase is mainly due to higher interest income on investment during the quarter. Our profit after tax was Rs. 69 crores for the quarter as compared to Rs. 75 crores during the corresponding period of previous year. For the first half of FY 2022 we registered revenue of Rs. 1,212 crores as compared to Rs. 939 crores in the corresponding period in the previous year. EBITDA was at Rs. 183 crores as compared to Rs. 184 crores in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our profit after tax was Rs. 100 crores for the first half of FY 2022 as compared to Rs. 99 crores during the corresponding period of the previous year. At the end of September 30\", 2021, we have 400 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 6% to our Hl FY 2022 revenues. Exports are also picking up with opening of market and contributing more than 3.5% of revenue in H1 FY 2022. Going forward we are cautious about the inflationary trend in the raw material prices which has further intensified and has reached elevated levels impacting gross margins. However, we are taking all possible measures to mitigate its impact on margins including timely price increase. We will continue our effort to grow our presence in untapped and under penetrated market and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.'},\n",

It has been a very sharp increase and despite that we have seen a margin pressure in the quarter. So, first of all, how should we think about this price increase and consumer reaction to that. And how should we think about margins based on this price increase going forward? Ramesh Kumar Dua : The way things are, raw material prices are still on the increase. They are yet to stabilize. All that was hoped that in the third quarter things will stabilize. But now still things are volatile, and we are keeping a watch on it on day-day-basis and accordingly we are revising our prices. But at the same time, naturally when there is unprecedented increase, there is always a consumer resistance. So, we are cautious while increasing our prices. So, we have been able to absorb part of the raw material increase in cost. But we have to also be mindful of the competition and take steps appropriately accordingly. We are taking our price increases accordingly from time to time. Already, twice we have increased the price in the past, and third is also being planned and we will keep on acting the way things are turning out to be.'},\n",

We have already shared our earnings press release and results presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q4 FY 2021 financial performance, followed by full year FY 2021 Financial Performance. In Q4 FY 2021, Relaxo booked operating revenue of Rs. 748 crores, which is a growth of 38% year-on-year. The strong revenue growth was partially due to low base of Q4 FY 2020, as we know sales was impacted in Q4 of last year due to lockdown in the month of March last year. EBITDA during the quarter was Rs. 163 crores which was a strong growth of 69% as compared to the corresponding period of previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 21.8% vis- √†-vis EBITDA margin of 17.8% in Q4 FY 2020. Our profit after tax was Rs. 102 crores for the quarter, up by 97% year-on-year with a PAT margin of 13.7%. For FY 2021, our revenue declined marginally by 2% to Rs. 2,359 crores with EBITDA margin of 21%. Our PAT of Rs. 292 crores in FY 2021, with a margin of 12.4% grew by 29% year-on-year, mainly due to product mix and saving in selling and administrative expenses. During FY 2021, we generated a cash of Rs. 513 crores from operations and spent Rs. 142 crores in CAPEX and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of March 2021, we have 398 exclusive brand outlets which contribute around 7% of total revenue. Export is holding its ground and contributing around 4% of revenue. During the ongoing crisis, we are undertaking all necessary measures to ensure safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We continue to support and provide assistance to our distributor and customers. Due to lockdown in various parts of India, overall demand for footwear is subdued right now. However, we believe that demand for footwears will bounce back whenever these restrictions are lifted. The second wave of COVID-19 India is more severe and continues to impact lives and livelihood. We stand with all those affected and are dedicated toward protecting and supporting our employees, partners and communities in the face of this unfolding crisis. Relaxo, remains committed towards its stakeholder by creating a sustainable, profitable and growing business. The company enjoys comfortable liquidity position with zero net debt and continues to provide assistance to its distributors and vendors. Despite the uncertainty related to the extent and length of the fresh wave, we believe that company is well placed to emerge stronger in the post COVID- 19 world. We remain committed to give the best experience and value for money to our customer and creating long-term value for our shareholders. We can now open the floor for question. Thank you very much.'},\n",

If you look at the gross margins, both on Y-o-Y as well as even on a Q-o-Q basis our gross margins were actually down, because in this quarter we are 56.8%, in the previous quarter they were 58.9%. So, how much is inflation in raw material currently? Because I understand that most of these petrochemical based imports have moved up even in the month of March, April and May. And secondly, how much price increase we have undertaken? And will we be able to sustain gross margins at the current levels? So, that is my question number one, first part of the margins. The second bit on the margin side, if you look last year, we have cut down on our overhead significantly. If I look at full year, they are down by nearly 400 bps, and you are yourself indicating that the ad spend will go up. Now, looking at this scenario that this year supply spend will comeback, raw materials are high, so what sort of outlook on margins would you like to get from here on? So, this is my first question on margins.'},\n",

When the rubber was 100, then it was 250, these things do happen to any business cycle, and we have gone through it. So, what is our strategy? Every quarter, whatever price are, accordingly, we will then take our decision, keeping in view the market condition, price revision is done. So, whatever is required and is possible then we pass it on to our customers. So, this is what we have been doing. Raw material, naturally will always vary. But at the same time, we have to be watchful about competitive intensity in the market. And then you can't just immediately have the kind of knee-jerk reaction to prices and then after three months you may say, okay, now price have gone down so we reduce it. So, there has to be a kind of stability, from our best judgment we pass on the price compared to industry and looking at the competitive intensity, and accordingly take the decision and next quarter again we review the things. So, this is what we have been doing since ages, and this is what we tend to do in future also; Keep on watching the prices, keep on quarterly reviewing the market conditions and accordingly passing on. When margin is concerned, naturally this year things are different, so we have to watch the market conditions and take a decision. The way things are, gross margin may get impacted. But on the overall year basis, we have to wait and see, we can't say now. Accordingly, management also does a course correction in between also. Regarding branding, actually , that is the call we have taken, but then we keep on reviewing all these things. Market is very volatile, raw material or others wise.

       "   'text': 'Good afternoon. I am Sushil Batra from Relaxo. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the Q2FY21. We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q2 FY21 financial performance followed by H1FY21 financial performance. In Q2 FY21, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of Rs. 576 crore as compared to Rs. 622 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The drop in Revenue in Q2 is due to disruptions in economic activities caused by COVID-19 pandemic. Benign raw material prices and saving in administrative expenses led to an improvement in the EBITDA margin to 22% as against 16.8% in same quarter last year. Other income stood at Rs. 5 crore as compared to Rs. 2 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase is mainly on account of lease rent waiver/reduction of Rs. 2 crore agreed by lessors for our rented premises. Profit before tax was Rs. 100 crore for the quarter, up by 35% YoY with a PBT margin of 17.4%. Tax expenses for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2020 reflect changes made vide Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019 as adopted by the Company. Therefore, effective tax rate of quarter ended September 30, 2020 is not comparable with previous comparative period of September 30, 2019 as the Company had recognised the full impact of this change in Profit & Loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Profit after tax at Rs. 75 crore for the quarter, is up by 6% YoY with a PAT margin of 13.0%. For First half of FY 2021, we registered a revenue of Rs. 939 crore as compared to Rs. 1,270 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. EBITDA margins increased to 19.6% from 16.6% while PAT margins increased to 10.6% from 9.5% helped by favourable raw material prices. At the end of Sep 30th, 2020, we have 396 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 5% to our H1FY21 revenues. We have added net 6 new stores in this period. Exports are also picking up with opening of markets and are contributing around 4% of revenues. Going forward, we are cautious about the recent rising trend of raw material prices. We would continue our efforts to grow our presence in untapped and under- penetrated markets and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.'},\n",

If you see brand wise, in the close footwear category majorly, there has been impact, but in open footwear we are getting a good demand for the Hawai brand, the Flite brand and the Bahamas. So, there is a good demand coming in open footwear. The second thing is work from home is also happening so there is more demand of open footwear and less for the closed shoes.'},\n",

Ramesh Kumar Dua : Our purpose of EBO is a little different, strategic one. They are kind of display and exhibition of our products on the sale counters where our purpose is to capture the voice of the consumer and accordingly develop the new products so that we can understand the evolving need of the consumers about our products, the new products that we have launched, so currently we have around 400 outlets, but that is enough to understand the market. But if you want to go to south and west then it is a different thing commercially and then it must make economic sense. Today it is serving us marketing sense, where we understand the market, so from that point of view our objective is being well met with, so currently we do not have any plans to have such kind of outlets in other parts of the country.'},\n",

Just continuing on the RM and the gross margin EBITDA, we have seen some of the best gross margin being posted in this quarter, I think much better than what we have reported in a very long history, so would be attributed to the crude price collapsing and that come into the benefit and is there any price hike? I think I remember you had about 2%, 3% price hike few months back, is it impacting? and just remind us from what kind of pricing action taken in the last six months or so if you have any and I think gross margins is also not understandable in the sense that the close footwear has been reasonably weak and probably it might have had some impact on the mix as well, so just wanted to understand the gross margins a bit and is there any one off in these numbers.'},\n",

Now when the market will start opening up then we will have to do more expenses on marketing sales promotion, brand building and all that. There was saving on travel expenses, and other administrative expenses also. The raw material also was quite comfortably priced. On the one hand prices of raw material will go up, well travel expenses, marketing and branding will go up as well. So, this what we have achieved in Q2 does not mean it is going to be the norm of the day. We have to be in the market in a competitive manner and accordingly have to take decisions. So as far as third or fourth quarter is concerned, our expenses will be more, so this kind of EBITDA margin should not be expected. Margin will be good, better, but it will be in a more reasonable manner. Let us wait how the raw material prices move which we will come to know in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, whenever some intervention of price increase is required then we will do, we have to review it every quarter, what are the prices of the raw material, other inputs, market scenario, competitiveness of the articles in the market and then we have to take a mature decision on that.'},\n",

I had only one question just trying to understand results a little more at a granular level, we had a volume growth of 2% this quarter and sales decline of 7% and this gap is even despite lower cash discounts, lower trade spends and promotions and so on and just trying to understand why there is such a big gap between volume growth and sales decline, is it mix and if it is mix then it has actually benefitted our gross margins. so just a little more color on this number?'},\n",

       "   'text': 'Good afternoon to everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the financial year 2019-20. We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation, hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q4 FY20 financial performance followed by Full year FY20 financial performance. In Q4 FY20, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of 540 cr down by 15% Year on Year. This impact was mainly due to nationwide lockdown. Due to adoption of IND AS 116, our rental expenses have reduced, and simultaneously depreciation and interest expenses have increased. The total impact of this new accounting standard on EBITDA is an increase of 45.23 cr. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 17.8% vs. EBITDA margin of 15% in Q4FY19. EBITDA margin of 17.8% for Q4FY20 stands at 15.7% without IND AS 116. As informed earlier our Company has chosen to exercise the option of lower tax rate of 25.168% as introduced by the Taxation Laws Ordinance 2019. Our Profit after tax was 52 cr for the quarter, down by 4.8% YoY with a PAT margin of 9.58%. For FY 2020, we registered a revenue of Rs 2410 cr, up by 5% with Gross margin of 56.88% and EBITDA margin of 17%. Favourable raw material prices and premiumization supported this growth. Our PAT of 226 cr in FY20 with a PAT margin of 9.4% grew by 29% YoY mainly due to cost control initiatives in manufacturing excellence and lower tax rates. During FY20, we generated a cash of 319 cr from operation and spent 208 cr in capex and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of 31st March, 2020, we have 390 exclusive brand outlets which contributed 8% to our FY20 revenues. We have added net 47 new stores in this period. Exports have expanded to new territories and is contributing 4% of revenues. During the ongoing crisis, we are undertaking all necessary measures to ensure safety and well-being of our employees and partners. The Company is strictly adhering to Government guidelines and have started operations in plants and offices. Prior to starting of operations, we have developed detailed SOP for safety of its employees. Proper equipment and sanitization material and mask has been provided at all locations. We continue to support and provide assistance to our dealers, distributors and customers. Due to nationwide lockdown overall demand for overall footwear is subdued but demand for open slipper segment has improved during the period. However due to restrictions in manufacturing operations fulfilment of such demand will be a challenge in short term. The Company has paid all long term debts in FY20 and its liquidity position is comfortable. Moreover, with start of business activities the liquidity position of the Company will continue to be comfortable. Relaxo has always been one of the most trusted brands and we believe that the Company is well placed to emerge stronger in post COVID world. We will continue to adopt strategic initiatives to strengthen our brand positioning, improve our product innovation and expansion into newer geographies. We can now open floor to questions. Thank you.'},\n",

B P Rajesh: That is very helpful.

       "   'text': 'Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal 20. We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation, hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q2 FY20 financial performance followed by H1FY20 financial performance. In Q2 FY20, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of 622 cr up by 14.5% Year on Year. This revenue growth was the result of across-the-board performance with our Sparx and Flite, PU, Bahamas categories registering higher growth than other categories. Advantage of price increase took in past helped in the growth of this quarter. This quarter growth is a mix of value and volume growth. Benign raw material prices and increased premiumisation in some categories led to an improvement in the gross margin to 56% as against 53% in same quarter last year. Our employee expenses were 11.6% of revenue and almost similar to that of Q1FY20. The increase in absolute value of employee expenses in Q2FY20 as compared to corresponding period of last year is due to inflationary growth, creation of new position in sales and addition of manpower for our new production capacities. Due to adoption of IND AS 116, our rental expenses have reduced, and simultaneously depreciation and interest expenses have increased. The total impact of this new accounting standard on EBITDA is an increase of 11.8 cr. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 16.8% vs. EBITDA margin of 16.4% in Q1FY20 and 13.5% in Q2FY19. EBITDA margin of 16.8% for Q2FY20 stands at 15% without IND AS 116. Our Company has chosen to exercise the option of lower tax rate of 25.168% as introduced by the Taxation Laws Ordinance 2019. The full impact of this change has been recognized was 71 cr for the quarter, up by 79% YoY with a PAT margin of 11.3%. For First half of FY 2020, we registered a revenue of 1270 cr, up by 15% Gross margin of 55% and EBITDA margin of 16.6%. Favourable raw material prices in FY20 and volume & value mix supported this growth. Our PAT of 120 cr in H1FY20 with a PAT margin of 9.5% grew by 41% YoY. During H1 of FY20, we generated a cash of 160 cr from operation and spent 74 cr in capex and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of Sep 30th, 2019, we have 370 exclusive brand outlets which contributed 7% to our H1FY20 revenues. We have added net 27 new stores in this period. Exports have expanded to new territories and are contributing 4% of revenues. Going forward, we expect raw material prices to remain favourable. We would continue our efforts to grow our presence in untapped and under-penetrated markets and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions.'},\n",

EBITDA was at Rs. 95 Crores as against last year Rs. 98 Crores, so corresponding period of the previous year due to higher raw material prices, EBITDA margin in this quarter was 15%. Financial cost stood at Rs. 1.73 Crores. There is a decrease of 29% as compared to last year quarter. PAT was at Rs. 54 Crores as compared to last year quarter Rs. 53 Crores.

Overall our strong execution delivered a good quarter ended the fiscal on a strong note on growth in revenue mainly driven by volume. During the year, the margins were under pressure due to higher raw material prices; however, the impact was contained as we continued to focus on operational efficiency and streamlining product offering in the market.

So is there some because on one direction you are saying that the prices are expected to correct and on the other you held on to high inventory, does that mean that you are setting at a higher inventory and probably in the near term margins could be under pressure?'},\n",

Lakshminarayana G: If I look at your ASP for FY2018, I do not have the latest number though around Rs.125, Rs.130 per pair that is probably at the lower end of in terms of your competition when I compare it is probably the lowest. So, how does management think about pricing power with the respect to the Sparx brand as well as Flite and are there any product gaps that the management is looking to introduce and take this up a little higher may be in future, is there a plan to get into leather and so on, so if you could talk about something around ASPs and how you think about that whether the pricing power exists especially in the premium brand?

We have already uploaded the earnings press release and the investor presentation on the stock exchange as well as on our website. And we hope that you have had an opportunity to go through them. Before we begin the question and answer session, let me quickly go through some of the highlights of Q2 and H1 FY25 performance, beginning with Q2. Revenue from operations in Q2 FY25 was at INR 679 crores as compared to INR 715 crores in Q2 FY24, a decline of 5% year-on-year. This is mainly due to weak market demand during the quarter. Our EBITDA for the quarter was at INR 88 crores as compared to INR 92 crores in the corresponding quarter in the previous year. The company maintained its EBITDA margin at 12.9% during the quarter as compared to 12.8% in Q2 FY24, despite the subdued demand. PAT was at INR 37 crores as compared to INR 44 crores reported in Q2 FY24. PAT margin for Q2 FY25 stood at 5.4% as compared to 6.2% in Q2 FY24. Higher depreciation in the quarter has impacted the profitability of the company. Now moving to our H1 FY25 performance. In H1 FY25, we recorded a revenue of INR 1,428 crores, EBITDA was at INR 187 crores compared to INR 199 crores in the same period of last year. EBITDA margin was at 13.1% as compared to 13.7% in H1 FY24. PAT for H1 FY25 stood at INR 81 crores against INR 101 crores in H1 FY24. PAT margin was at 5.7% as compared to 6.9% in H1 FY24. The company has incurred a capex of INR 49 crores till 30th September '24. Our company continues to be net debt free and supported by positive cash flow from operations. Our company is in process of adding new distributors and focusing on to improve retail network through various initiatives. Further in line with our continued focus on cost efficiencies, we are performance in the future. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.\n",

There is poor footfalls, demand is also subdued and the raw material prices, all these things, because of multiple factors, they were able to enter.

This year, we had to actually say no to Flipkart and Amazon because they generally give too much discount and that affects us. So we have to be very cautious in the changing scenario. Things are conflicting. They're very complex also. kind of conflicting and not complementary but sometimes totally opposite. Whatever we think about the general trade, that affects our e-commerce.

      "Text: Sorry, I've joined the call late, so please pardon me if I'm repeating anything that has been answered before. Sir, I just wanted to check on your remarks that the industry has sort of witnessed an increase in lower priced unorganized competition. So firstly, I wanted to check what exactly is this unorganized competition. So earlier during this entire calendar year, the imports from China, etcetera, were on a decline. But now over the last couple of months, I guess, the imports of such articles have seen an increase. Are you referring to this? Or are you referring to all those smaller-scale MSMEs that are operating from India and they have suddenly increased the competitive intensity in that space?\n",

      "Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua\n",
      "Text: Yes, it's actually both. Plus 2 years back, there was a change of GST from 5% to 12%. Since then, like a lot of new players or unorganized competitors have come up. There are multiple reasons for that. One is the lower-priced raw material. When the raw material price goes down, definitely new players come in. And the price goes up, they really vanish. Plus, definitely, we can talk about these are regional players, which have been having no brand, not paying GST. They don't have BIS compliance. So they are taking some market share. And there are a lot of imports happening, like what you were saying about China imports, it has not reduced, but it has increased because government have allowed them until September to import product. After that, they cannot because then the BIS will be applicable. So multiple factors, not one or two.\n",

I mean if we are not going to participate, then how is the separate portfolio going to help? offering huge discounts. Other small activities or any other days, we will be there. Our only thing is to protect the interest of both channels. We have to see about the brand also, at what level we can give discount. And it should be in concurrence with us, how they decide the discounting policy. It cannot be wherever they want, they can give what kind of discount they can offer like.

We have already uploaded the earnings press release and the investor presentation on the stock exchanges as well at our website and hope that you have had the opportunity to go through those. Before we begin the question-answer session, let me quickly go through the Q4 and FY24 performance, starting with Q4. During Q4FY24, we recorded revenue of Rs. 747 crores as compared to Rs. 765 crores in Q4FY23, reporting a marginal decline of 2.3% year-on-year on account of slight decline in volumes. EBITDA for the quarter was at Rs. 120 crores, up by 2% year-on-year from Rs. 118 crores in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. EBITDA margins were up marginally by 69 basis points and stood at 16.1% in Q4FY24 as against 15.4% in Q4FY23. PAT was at Rs. 61 crores as compared to Rs. 63 crores reported in Q4FY23. PAT margin for Q4FY24 remained flat at around 8.2%. Now coming on the full year FY24. We have achieved a moderate growth of 4.7% year-on-year from Rs. 2,783 crores in FY23 to Rs. 2,914 crores in FY24. This performance was largely driven by a significant uptick in open footwear volumes, a witness to the efficacy of our strategic initiatives to regain market share. EBITDA for the year was at Rs. 407 crores as against Rs. 336 crores in FY23, registering a growth of 21.1%. EBITDA margin was at 14%, improved by 188 basis points year-on-year as against 12.1% in FY23. Margins majorly benefited from the softening of raw material prices, which was partially offset by the increased fixed costs. PAT was at Rs. 200 crores in FY24 as compared to Rs. 154 crores in FY23, recording a significant growth of 29.8%. PAT margin was 6.9% during FY24 against 5.6% in FY23, improving by 133 basis points year-on-year. In FY24, the company incurred a total CapEx of Rs. 248 crores, including a purchase of 30-acre land parcel in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, worth Rs. 127 crores. We remain a net debt-free company recognition. We continue to explore new avenues and focus on other new channels and e- commerce platforms for growth. We are confident that our ongoing efforts will lead to favourable results for us in the future. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions.\n",

So can you give some more colour what segment, which segment and which markets is driving this? And something more on the inventory side, is the inventory is now under control in the field? Or do you think it will take some more time? And the second question is on the pricing bit. What kind of pricing aspiration we will hold or we will continue the similar price over FY ‚Äò25?\n",

So if you see that subdued growth or a little minus coming in, that the main reason was that we were implementing BIS. So there was some confusion in the market, how it will be implemented. So we increased price marginally. And then we saw that we were able to implement all this BIS. And what is the second question?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: No. Because in the past, there was a lot of volatility in the raw material prices that affected us. Since we have to import the raw materials, we have to maintain a long supply chain, but now things are stable. That is why we are telling things will be a little better.\n",

We have already uploaded the earnings press release and investor presentation on the Stock Exchange as well as at our website and hope you have had the opportunity to go through those. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, let me give some highlights on Q2 and H1 FY24 Financial Performance of the Company, beginning with Q2: Revenue in Q2 FY24 was Rs. 715 crores, up 7% from Rs. 670 crores in Q2 FY23. We witnessed strong demand during the quarter which has led to a strong recovery in volumes driven by open footwear. EBITDA recorded a strong 54% Y-on-Y growth at Rs. 92 crores as against Rs. 59 crores in the corresponding quarter of last year. Softening of raw material prices and better operational efficiency due to economies of scale enabled us to enhance our EBITDA margin by 392 bps in this quarter. EBITDA margin was at 12.8% in Q2 FY24 as against 8.9% in Q2 FY23. PAT almost doubled in this quarter at Rs. 44 crores as against Rs. 22 crores in Q2 FY23. PAT margin stood at 6.2%, up 283 bps from 3.3% in Q2 FY23. In H1 FY24 we recorded a revenue of Rs. 1,454 crores vis-√†-vis Rs. 1,337 crores in H1 FY23, an increase of 9% year-on-year basis. EBITDA was at Rs. 199 crores from Rs. 146 crores in same period of last year, up by 37%. EBITDA margin was at 13.7% as compared to 10.9% in H1 FY23, an expansion of 280 bps. PAT for H1 FY24 at Rs. 101 crores against Rs. 61 crores in H1 FY23, grew by 65%. PAT margin was at 6.9% as compared to 4.6% in H1 FY23. The company incurred a CAPEX of Rs. 56 crores as on 31st September ‚Äô23. We remain a net debt-free Company with positive cash from operations. We remain committed to provide quality product as per evolving customer needs with focus on premium and innovative products.

So, exactly what kind of strategy you are looking at? Higher number of pairs to be sold and with less value or other way around. That‚Äôs the first question.\n",

So, our volume growth has been more than 20%. As far as premiumization is concerned, focus is there in Sparx, in Bahamas and already we are having a good traction of these premium articles.

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: Last year because of higher, we had a lot of old stock, costly inventory in the system. Because our industry operates on lot of import materials, we have to have a supply chain of around 6 months of that material. So, that is why it took some time to consume. Meanwhile market rate had fallen. But now our inventory in the system, now it is comfortable.\n",

So, we had a very good trade show I think a couple of months back where we had displayed the entire range of our closed sportswear. I just wanted to understand a couple of things. First is Q3 typically is your large quarter for sportswear. So, how is the initial response and what is the kind of demand and growth that we are seeing? Our composition of sportswear‚ÄîI think correct me if I‚Äôm wrong‚Äîis somewhere about Rs. 250 and 300 crores. So, what kind of growth we expect? And our competitor has had a significant size and I think we‚Äôve also had aspiration to grow significantly, so do you think this is a category which can be somewhere close to like a Rs. 1,000 crores contributor to you in probably a few years?\n",

Regarding the market situation as you know the market is still not picked up what we were expecting. So, we have done lot of retail meets across India and distributor meets. The initial response because of this Pitrupaksha and untimely rains, market has still not given good feedback till now in terms of uptake in the market. So, it‚Äôs too early. Diwali is in November, so we are expecting November should be better.\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir\n",
      "Text: So, our base would be very low, so of course from that base we should see a very good performance even in Q3. And just a follow up over there is that one feedback on the ground is that the margins in the sportswear is not very compelling and therefore Relaxo sportswear is not very well received by the distributors and retailers. Have we made any changes over there? Do you think we have addressed the issues at the distributor level?\n",

      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",

Have we seen any, how far we have reached in terms of implementation and are we seeing any positive impact? Because one common feedback we were getting is the wholesaler were undercutting on pricing basically. If you can just highlight something on DMS.\n",

Regarding price cut, price cut by distributor we have not seen that. But maybe it's not in the DMS that they can cut the price. DMS is just to get the inventory and how we can do secondary with them and align our schemes accordingly. DMS is not implemented to control the distributor discount to the retailer. It is mainly to drive the secondary and have the control how things are going.\n",

      "Speaker: Sachee Trivedi\n",
      "Text: Thank you for taking my question. The question I have is that in a previous earnings call, you had indicated that Sparx revenue will go from Rs. 400 crores to around Rs. 1,000 crores over the next 2-3 years which I think was around FY26. Is that still something in your plan and if yes then how do you plan to execute towards this goal?\n",

      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: Though this year has been a little challenging. But our focus on premiumization is particularly in Sparx category and particularly on shoes and this year there are a lot of premium articles in Sparx, and we are getting a good traction. Based on our experience we are focusing on this and likely to grow but not this year. It is a year of stabilization and improvement and learning and accordingly then we'll open retail outlets also, we will utilize e-commerce also, the things will go accordingly.\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Sachee Trivedi\n",
      "Text: Your other expenses have gone up 24% year-on-year. I'm assuming this is sales and marketing and promotion. Is this to help the Sparx brand or is this for everything, all the product categories?\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",

      "Speaker: Sachee Trivedi\n",
      "Text: Okay, Now in terms of your distribution channels you have the MBO, you have the EBO, and you have the online channel. Do you think you should be looking at a differential pricing across these three channels given that the customer that comes to your e-commerce channel is very different from a customer that comes to your MBO channel?\n",
      "Sentiment: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",
      "Text: So, if you see instead of having different pricing, we have different brand offerings. So, Sparx is more relevant for EBOs and online because it's more than Rs. 1000 MRP. And for the mass market or MBO outlets which are 1 lakh outlet across India, for them we have Hawaii and we have Flite and Bahamas brand. So, we have segmented brand according to the price rather than giving different discounts.\n",
      "Sentiment: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Sachee Trivedi\n",
      "Text: And then one question on your MBO market particularly in the rural segment, should we think of it as a consumer discretionary spend or is it actually an important spend because if somebody's chappal is broken then they need to replace it? And then the question is why are they not buying a Relaxo brand to replace the chappal and going for something else?\n",
      "Sentiment: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",
      "Text: What we have seen is that because of inflation their visits have been little reduced. So, that's why what we are seeing is that the payments are not coming from the distributor and from the retailers. So, because of inflation and their discretionary spend going down, they are little selective in buying. That is the trend from last 6 months. But we are hoping that this will improve because of festive season coming and stabilization of prices are there. Raw material has been stabilized, so there should be an uptake in the demand.\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Sachee Trivedi\n",

      "Sentiment: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",
      "Text: If you have seen we have grown in volume, so we have definitely gained the market share there also. But that Sparx is the category where we are seeing that the spends have because it's more of discretionary where the buying has been low.\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Sachee Trivedi\n",
      "Text: Sparx is discretionary but your Relaxo brand Bahamas and Flite particularly where you are selling to the rural and many times in the call, you have mentioned that is where you are seeing a slowdown, and you are hoping the festival season will see an uptick. And I'm challenging that part and asking if actually a Relaxo chappal is a consumer staple item for that market.\n",
      "Sentiment: negative (Confidence: 0.686)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",
      "Text: No, we agree with that. But overall market should also have been growing. We are growing in that space. But industry also has to grow. There should be huge demand from the consumer side, so all categories will grow. We are not facing any challenge in open footwear.\n",

The earning press release and the investor presentation have been uploaded on the stock exchange as well as at our website, and we hope you have had the chance to go through these. Before we begin the question and answer, I will quickly go through the Q4 and FY '23 performance starting with Q4. In Q4 FY '23, we recorded revenue of INR 765 crores as against INR 698 crores in Q4 FY '22, recording a growth of 10% year-on-year. On a Q-on-Q basis, the revenue increased by 12%. This is mainly due to volume growth across all categories. Our Q4 FY '23 EBITDA was at INR 118 crores, up by 6% year-on-year, from INR 111 crores in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. EBITDA margins were at 15.4% in Q4 FY '23 as against 15.9% in the corresponding quarter. On a Q-on-Q basis, EBITDA margins have grown substantially by 481 basis points due to the selling of low cost inventory along with costly old inventory. PAT at INR63 crores, on a sequential basis, that grew by 110% from INR30 crores in Q3 FY '23. PAT margin for Q4 FY '23 was 8.3%. Our price correction efforts during the last quarter have resulted in good momentum, and we have continued our market share recovery in all major segments during this quarter without relying much on discounts and offers. Now moving on to full year FY '23. Despite the challenging environment last year, our strong team responded effectively and our commitment to maintaining our high standard of excellence have made us successful. Revenue for FY '23 was at INR 2,783 crores, up by 5% year-on-year from INR 2,653 crores in FY '22. EBITDA was at INR 336 crores as against INR 416 crores in FY '22. EBITDA margin was at 12.1% as against 15.7% in FY '22. Margins were affected We are now a debt-free company with robust cash flow from operation due to our strong working capital management. During the year, the company incurred a capex of INR 174 crores. With the stabilization of raw fuel prices in Q4, we are currently experiencing strong demand and hold an optimistic view of the future. Our company is strategically positioned to take advantage of the opportunities within the industry, allowing us to further expand our market share. Our key strengths lie in our in-house manufacturing capabilities, the quality of our product, and the strong recall of our brand. We remain dedicated to upholding these strengths and will persistently strive to maintain their integrity. We are confident that our continued efforts will lead positive outcome for us in the time ahead. Thank you. Now we can open the floor for questions.\n",

      "Text: Congratulations to finally seeing a good market share trend in your company. I have 3 questions. First is on the current quarter. So I understand from our channel checks that post cleanup of the old inventory, market demand has picked up quite strongly. And in fact, Relaxo has not been able to meet all the distributor demand. So is this true in multiple geographies? And do you think we would have lost any revenue because of that factor, if you could just quantify what could have been the impact of that in this quarter? And has that been now subsided? Or we are still seeing demand not being able to fully be met?\n",

And second, this is a peak season for us for open footwear. As we are 75% open and 25% closed, so this is the open footwear starting from January to June to July. And regarding the shortages, we are managing. We have inventory with us and the uptake we are seeing across India for the open footwear.\n",

So always you have to be agile and watchful of all those conditions to improve the things.Gaurav Jogani: So if I summarize or understand it better, I think you would like to keep your margin in a tight range wherein you remain competitive versus the competitors, but at the same time, also drive profitability for the business.\n",

Like if I look at '17, '18 and '19, the ASPs were largely practiced at around about INR125. And in '23, again, we saw similar things. So should we consider Relaxo as more of a volume plus operating leverage story and less of a branding story?

      "Text: Thank you, Ali. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q2 and H1 FY2023 earnings call of Relaxo Footwears Limited. We have already uploaded our earnings press release and presentation at the exchanges, and we hope you have got an opportunity to review them. Before we open the floor for question-and-answer session, I would like to take you through an overview of the numbers of Q2 and H1 FY2023. During Q2 FY2023, the company reported total revenue of Rs.670 Crore as compared to Rs.714 Crore in Q2 FY2022, registering a decline of 6.3% year-on-year. The performance remained subdued mainly on account of fall in volumes in Q2 FY2023 in the categories serving the masses. With consumer facing inflationary pressures affecting affordability, there has been a shift in consumer habits as they moved towards cheaper alternative at the cost of quality. This prompted the company to take an aggressive price correction in September 2022 to remain competitive in the current market. This price specialization approach has been welcomed by distributor and customer, which would help us clear high-cost inventory in the coming quarter and ultimately improve our volume number going ahead. EBITDA in Q2 FY2023 was at Rs.59 Crore as compared to Rs.117 Crore in Q2 FY2022. This degrowth in EBITDA was mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices. EBITDA margin during the Q2 FY2023 was at 8.9% and declined by 748 bps year-on-year. The profit after tax was at Rs.22 Crore in Q2 FY2023 as compared to Rs.69 Crore in Q2 FY2022. Moving to our H1 FY2023 performance, the total revenue was at Rs.1,337 Crores and grew by 10.3% year-on-year as compared to Rs.1,212 Crore in H1 FY2022. EBITDA was at Rs.146 Crores from Rs.183 Crore in H1 FY2022. The company reported a profit after tax of Rs.61 Crore in H1 FY2023 as compared to Rs.100 Crore in H1 FY2022. Strong fundamentals complemented by wide distribution reach, strong brand recall and better sourcing capability we are optimistic about overcoming this tough phase and focus on delivery, steady revenue growth in both domestic and export going forward. Thank you. Now we can open the floor for questions.\n",

So, one, if you can highlight what is the quantum of the price cut that you have taken, and how much of that has impacted the initial volumes? Because we understand that your distributors would have destocked initially, and because of which also there will be some volume impact.\n",

      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: Yes, I am Ramesh Kumar Dua this side. Just in the background, I want to tell you a few things. The main cause of our price increase in the past 1.5 year had been some of the raw material polymers like EVA, PVC, polyethylene, they have started gradually rising and kept on rising to an extent, the thing which we were getting at Rs.120 a kg, reached Rs.300 kg, and then this started falling also, and it came down to Rs.160. So, in such kind of volatile situation, where our company has to maintain a long supply chain because materials are imported, it has to be at least 6 months‚Äô supply chain. So when the things arise, then it is beneficial for the entire trade company and our customers. But when there is sudden fall, which historically, at least I have never witnessed. Such a fall from Rs.300, to become Rs.160, and local market becoming cheaper than the international market at which we got. Our way of pricing the products have been based on our costing. But now during this period, when the local raw material prices became lower than our cost prices, the local industry or other people who are always sourcing the material from local sources, they became competitive and also the affordability of the mass segment, that has been affected because of inflation all around. As a result, for our mass customers, they started shifting to cheaper products, never mind the quality, whether it lasts 2 months or 3 months, they are not bothered. They just want to while away this difficult period, which they are facing for inflation. So when the prices were rising gradually, we are forced to revise the prices upward. But when the raw material started falling or it became cheaper to the competition, they reacted very fast. But as far as our company is concerned, which has a long supply chain, we took our own time. Meanwhile, because of unaffordability of our article to the masses, they went for cheaper alternative. So that started affecting our sales. Now in the month of September, we have made some price correction so that we are competitive in the market. Never mind, it will affect our bottom line, but to be in the market, have volume sales, that is a kind of cautious call to maintain our market share in the market. So that has been the reason. Otherwise, if I want to tell you the gravity of the thing, EVA polymer, we are consuming around 1,000 tonnes per month that is in a year, 12,000 tonnes, and the material of this, which was Rs.120 kg, last year it became average Rs.210, you can see a difference of Rs.100 kg, 12,000 tonne, Rs.120 Crores for single material, and even in another 6 months, this year also, our average has been Rs.240. So this is the magnitude, which we say average is Rs.240, but in local it became Rs.160, so they became more competitive. We took this aggressive step to be competitive, but in the coming months, all those things are not still stabilized, the Rs.160, which was coming to local now it has become Rs.200. So things are very volatile. We are keeping an eye in the market, and we will keep on taking timely corrections, keeping in view of how the other markets are reacting. That is it.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Jogani\n",
      "Text: Just to follow up on this one. So one, what is the magnitude of price cut that you have taken in September, and second thing, now because you are saying the local markets, again, that price has become Rs.200 per kg, and you might be having some inventory because of this. So now does that place you better versus the competition because you have some earlier inventory also with you?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: Yes. Generally, our supply chain is around 6 months. The price correction has been around 15% to 20%. Our main segment that is affected is Hawaii and EVA segment. Other PU related footwear and Sparx shoe that is not affected. That has grown and it is okay also. It is only where EVA polymer is being consumed, they are in our Bahamas brand, and Relaxo and also Flite EVA category. There, our company has suffered because of this volatility. Even earlier, we were able to predict what will be the price of this material next year. But now our purchase department is not able to tell in guarantee what is going to be the price next quarter, such is the kind of volatility and instability. Under such volatile chaotic conditions, things have become quite challenging, and now we are keeping a close watch on the market and taking timely corrections, not based on our costing, but based on market conditions.\n",

You have highlighted that for you the Sparx and the sports shoes are relatively unimpacted. So according to you what is driving this difference? Wherein the sports shoes and the higher segment is growing, but people are not able to afford being the lower end of the segment.\n",

So, if my understanding is correct, out of about 20% of closed footwear, about 50% is sports and athleisure, right, which should be ballpark around Rs.250-odd Crores. So just wanted to understand, what are our plans there? A few of the recently listed companies and in fact, overall market, also a lot of smaller players have rapidly grown in the recent past. So, what are our plans here? we recently also added capacity in the sportswear. So how do we plan to grow this business over the next probably 3 years, if you could share your insights.\n",

      "Text: So, this sports shoe segment this divided into online sale and distributor sales, the channel sale. So, in both channels, we are seeing a good demand coming from the market, and that is why we have added the capacity there only. And we are adding more designs every year, like this year also we have added a lot of designs and we are giving a lot of trust to a placement of products in the market. So, we are expecting a good growth coming from these Sparx segments specially sports shoes.\n",

So we should be able to use our existing distribution reach or sportswear requires a different reach and therefore, it should be a very slow growth business.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir\n",
      "Text: Understood, and just second question is on the inventory situation. So given the fact that you have taken price cuts, you would obviously have a lot of inventory yet in the system, which is at a higher price point. So by when do you expect that inventory to get unwind, and then you should only have one price point or lower price point inventory available in the market.\n",

So it is a long supply chain. Company can get over quickly. But at retail and distributor level, it takes time, maybe 2 to 3 months more, so by March it will be everywhere new prices.\n",

Inflationary period is always beneficiary for organized players because of the scale, ability to manage supply chain volatility and in procurement, planning, production. Understandably, they should have an upper hand versus unorganized players. So in our case, it did not play out like that. So just wanted to understand, was it different in our case or there were some more headwinds or unprecedented headwinds which did not allow us to capitalize on this opportunity?\n",

If you consume 1,000 tonnes a month, at that time, local market availability of the material came down at Rs.160 - Rs.180. But we have a long supply chain, which we are buying, and our average price was Rs.240 for the year. So it was just in this 3 - or 4-month period when they became advantageous because we have a long supply chain thereby supply short supply chain. But this happens once in a life that prices go down and they became advantageous. It is very rare phenomena. It is just a matter of time. Otherwise, we cannot be dependent at all on local sources. Our factory will come to a halt. To have uninterrupted, no disruption, manufacturing process, we have to maintain this sufficient inventory in the pipeline. During the lockdown period, even there was so much of scarcity of material and even getting containers to ship the material became a challenge.

      "Text: Thank you Akhil. Good afternoon, everyone. Ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the financial year 2021-22. We have already shared our earnings press release and result presentation. Hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q4 FY22 Financial Performance followed by full year FY22 Financial Performance. In Q4 FY22 Relaxo booked operating revenue of 698 crores as compared to Rs. 748 crores in the corresponding period of previous year. Revenue during the quarter was affected due to disruption caused by Omicron variant of COVID, GST rate hike from 5% to 12% w.e.f. January ‚Äò22 on footwear priced below Rs. 1,000 and subdued demand due to high inflation. EBITDA during the quarter is at Rs. 111 crores as compared to Rs. 163 crores in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter is 15.9%. EBITDA margin decreased mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices and extra support provided to trade towards GST rate differential on inventory. Our profit after tax is Rs. 63 crores for the quarter as compared to Rs. 102 crores in the corresponding period of previous year. For FY2022 our revenues stood at Rs. 2,653 crores as compared to the Rs. 2,359 crores which is a growth of 12% year-on-year. The growth in revenue is achieved mainly due to calibrated price hike taken during the year to mitigate impact of high raw material prices. EBITDA is at Rs. 416 crores as compared to Rs. 495 crores in the previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the year is 15.7%. The decline in EBITDA margin is mainly on account of increase in raw material prices and normalization of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in FY22 as compared to FY21. Our profit after tax is Rs. 233 crores as compared to Rs. 292 crores during the previous year. During FY2022 we generated cash of Rs. 140 crores from operation and spent Rs. 140 crores in CAPEX. At the end of March 31st, 2022, we have 394 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 7% of our FY22 revenue. Export crossed Rs. 100 crores mark and is picking up with opening of market and its contribution is more than 4% of revenue of FY2022. Going forward we are cautious about our continual extraordinary inflation and remain cautiously optimistic on the basis of strong recovery across category, especially in the high-value closed footwear category after opening up of offices, schools, and colleges. We believe that we are well positioned in the footwear marketplace by providing the right price value equation to our customer while making sure our product remains affordable and accessible. We remain committed to all our stakeholders by creating a strong foundation for the future which can provide a sustainable and profitable growth for the long term. Thank you. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Speaker: Tejas Shah\n",
      "Text: Just will start with a couple of basic questions. If you can help us to understand the realization split increase which has happened between price increase and premiumization if any happened during the year and during the quarter?\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 0.997)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Sushil Batra\n",
      "Text: Price increase, because this full year was lot of inflation, raw material prices went up. Price increase was in the range of 25% across all the categories, in few categories more and few categories less. This is majorly due to the price increase and product mix because closed footwear was sold much more as compared to FY21. That mix also happened in this year. Overall increase majorly is due to price increase.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Tejas Shah\n",
      "Text: This 25% price increase would be at customer level, because of GST increase as well but that would not have totally reflected in our numbers, right?\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 0.527)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Sushil Batra\n",
      "Text: No, it's a mix of raw material and GST. GST came only in January ‚Äò22 that was the last increase which we took but overall, from start of the year from May onwards raw material prices were going up so we took three to-four price increase in full year.\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Tejas Shah\n",
      "Text: Second, though initial period yet, but almost 4-5 months have passed by after GST increase has happened. What is the initial feedback in terms of customer and both channel whether they have absorbed this price hike easily or it will take some more time for demand and channels to settle down on this?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",
      "Text: So, it's been 4 months you are right. What we are seeing is in first 2-3 months there was a pressure because it was new for the trade. So, there was a lot of resistance. People were talking about taking this price back from 12 to 5, they were giving lot of representation to the government but now it is settled. The rates have been settled. Post that there is definitely a pressure because of inflation, consumer sentiments are still not so great and whatever the pass on off price what we have done, or the industry has done its taking time for the consumer as well as for the trade to take it.\n",

      "Text: The last one, based on the recent channel checks which has been done on the sector it has seen that there's a huge traction in online channel for closed footwear especially the sports footwear or athleisure footwear. So, have we seen any such traction in our number a) what was our exposure to online channel for the full year as a company and also within the Sparx brand in particular?\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",
      "Text: Yes, Sparx brand has done very well in e-commerce platform and we can see the growth rate was more than 40% in e-commerce platform. There is a traction of a sports shoe selling more on e-com.\n",

      "Speaker: Gaurav Jogani\n",
      "Text: Thank you for taking my question. My first question is with regards to the RM inflation as you have highlighted. Is the bulk of the RM inflation now done or do we need to take further price increases to mitigate the RM inflation that we have seen?\n",
      "Sentiment: neutral (Confidence: 0.989)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: Raw material situation continues to remain unpredictable. You cannot say for guarantee that everything is settled. Always we are getting news of different kinds, sometimes packing material, chemicals, polymers. So, things are not stable as yet, we can‚Äôt say confidently things are stabilized as far the raw material situation is concerned. But we have to be watchful of it and accordingly we have to see market dynamics also and accordingly keep on taking appropriate action.\n",
      "Sentiment: neutral (Confidence: 0.987)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Jogani\n",
      "Text: To put the other way round if assuming whatever the RM prices are today, does it cover whatever the price increases that we have taken as on today, RM price do we cover it or do we need to still take further pricing action to cover the impact? Because the impact on margin is huge as can be seen from the results. Still do we need to take more price increases to even cover today's RM inflation.\n",
      "Sentiment: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: No, we have to wait and see all these things. Ultimately our goal at the moment is to focus on our market share in the market and keeping in view the article that we are in, which are meant for masses, lower rank of society. So that's very important that we will be keeping strict vigil on it and accordingly take appropriate actions at appropriate time.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Jogani\n",
      "Text: My next question is with regards to your volume if we see this particular year, so the volume this particular year has even seen a decline if we compare versus FY20. While I do agree that there was some impact during the first quarter due to Omicron and even this quarter was impacted. But how do you see the volume trajectory going ahead in the light of the sharp RM inflation that we are seeing given our target customer is very price sensitive?\n",
      "Sentiment: negative (Confidence: 0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",
      "Text: Last year if you remember in May we had this Corona wave where everything was shut down and followed by January also we had a small Omicron variant coming in. So definitely there has been a pressure on volume in term, because last to last year the open footwear was selling a lot because people were at home and there was extraordinary sales happening on last-to-last year. So, to sustain that was a challenge. Going forward the consumer sentiments are still not so buoyant. We feel I think after maybe Quarter 1 the things will come back but very difficult to say right now because of unpredictable supply chain things are not settled, raw material prices are not settled but we are hoping that Quarter 2 onwards we can see some recovery.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Jogani\n",
      "Text: One last question from my end is regarding the sportswear segment. The sportswear or so to say the casual footwear segment has been seeing very good traction as such. In this light we have seen lately, one of our competitors getting listed on the exchange and they have been showing smart growth in Q4 as well. In that light if you see what is our action towards the sportswear segment what are we doing to address that?\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Jogani\n",
      "Text: Anything that you're seeing, because on a general market check suggests that they are higher on the market share percentage-wise given that they are very dominant in that segment. Anything that we are doing in terms of product launches or expanding our reach on the online that you can highlight that we are increasing our presence there?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",

      "Speaker: Bharat Chhoda\n",
      "Text: Generally, when we see Relaxo has a good working capital cycle of around 50 days but this time it appears to be on the higher side of it closer to 90 days. What is the reason for the same? Is it more of raw material being accumulated or is it the finished goods? Can you just provide a brief view on that?\n",
      "Sentiment: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Sushil Batra\n",
      "Text: This has been because there was a pressure upon sale and price also. Our inventory has increased abnormally more than expected and there are two reasons for the inventory increase, one is the pressure upon sale and also the prices because your cost of goods and everything has increased. So, it has also given a multiplying effect upon the inventory. That is the one reason.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Sushil Batra\n",
      "Text: Just repeating. Inventory is the major reason for working capital disturbance in this year and there are two reasons, one there was pressure upon the sale and second because the cost of goods has also increased, even raw material also. We were carrying little more inventory just to be more cautious about the future price increase, so inventory has increased in the balance sheet. That is visible also. Second, there is a slight increase in some debtors. So, these are the two reasons the working capital is under pressure. Ramesh Kumar Dua Material locked up includes raw material also.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Bharat Chhoda\n",
      "Text: We have seen this the realization being significantly higher at this level do you see we would see we would see an impact on the volumes going ahead and probably also what is the margin we should work with? Is it 17%-18% kind of a margin that is possible for us to maintain with the current level ?\n",
      "Sentiment: positive (Confidence: 0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Sushil Batra\n",
      "Text: Margin definitely because this year being a little tough year comparatively and FY21 was a best year but if we compare FY20 the margins are definitely achievable, and we intend to and we are hopeful that will be achieved on FY20 base if you see.\n",

Initially there has been a comment from your side probably but post that stabilization is that volume again picking up?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",
      "Text: As you're well aware that because of inflation the purchasing power of the lower end of the pyramid, the mass market, they are feeling the pinch of inflation. Some of them are looking for cheaper alternatives you can understand because they have no money in their pocket. So, they are going for cheaper alternatives. There is a volume pressure no doubt about it. I think from Quarter 2 onwards this thing will be much better.\n",

In Q2 FY 2022, Relaxo booked operating revenue of Rs. 714 crores as compared to Rs. 576 crores which is a growth of 24% year-on-year. EBITDA during the quarter stood at Rs. 117 crores as compared to Rs. 127 crores during the corresponding period of previous year. EBITDA decreased mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices, enhancement of marketing, brand promotion and other administrative expenses as compared to corresponding period of last year wherein raw material prices were extremely low. Other Income stood at Rs. 7 crores as compared to Rs. 5 crores in the corresponding period in the previous year. The increase is mainly due to higher interest income on investment during the quarter. Our profit after tax was Rs. 69 crores for the quarter as compared to Rs. 75 crores during the corresponding period of previous year. For the first half of FY 2022 we registered revenue of Rs. 1,212 crores as compared to Rs. 939 crores in the corresponding period in the previous year. EBITDA was at Rs. 183 crores as compared to Rs. 184 crores in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our profit after tax was Rs. 100 crores for the first half of FY 2022 as compared to Rs. 99 crores during the corresponding period of the previous year. At the end of September 30\", 2021, we have 400 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 6% to our Hl FY 2022 revenues. Exports are also picking up with opening of market and contributing more than 3.5% of revenue in H1 FY 2022. Going forward we are cautious about the inflationary trend in the raw material prices which has further intensified and has reached elevated levels impacting gross margins. However, we are taking all possible measures to mitigate its impact on margins including timely price increase. We will continue our effort to grow our presence in untapped and under penetrated market and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Text: My first question pertains to the slide that you have shared in your presentation, the data on realization increase YoY. It has been a very sharp increase and despite that we have seen a margin pressure in the quarter. So, first of all, how should we think about this price increase and consumer reaction to that. And how should we think about margins based on this price increase going forward? Ramesh Kumar Dua : The way things are, raw material prices are still on the increase. They are yet to stabilize. All that was hoped that in the third quarter things will stabilize. But now still things are volatile, and we are keeping a watch on it on day-day-basis and accordingly we are revising our prices. But at the same time, naturally when there is unprecedented increase, there is always a consumer resistance. So, we are cautious while increasing our prices. So, we have been able to absorb part of the raw material increase in cost. But we have to also be mindful of the competition and take steps appropriately accordingly. We are taking our price increases accordingly from time to time. Already, twice we have increased the price in the past, and third is also being planned and we will keep on acting the way things are turning out to be.\n",

So, inventory in the pipeline is reducing. So, for the time being there is some effect on the demand that we are witnessing.

What I mean to say is when I look at the growth reported by Relaxo and if we have to compare that with the actual growth which a retailer or the distributer might have reported, with that growth be higher and then if that is the case, so as the retailers and the distributers starts to rebuild the inventory then that will ultimately benefit you in subsequent quarters, is it the right way to look at it?\n",

      "Text: Good afternoon to everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the financial year 2020-2021. We have already shared our earnings press release and results presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q4 FY 2021 financial performance, followed by full year FY 2021 Financial Performance. In Q4 FY 2021, Relaxo booked operating revenue of Rs. 748 crores, which is a growth of 38% year-on-year. The strong revenue growth was partially due to low base of Q4 FY 2020, as we know sales was impacted in Q4 of last year due to lockdown in the month of March last year. EBITDA during the quarter was Rs. 163 crores which was a strong growth of 69% as compared to the corresponding period of previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 21.8% vis- √†-vis EBITDA margin of 17.8% in Q4 FY 2020. Our profit after tax was Rs. 102 crores for the quarter, up by 97% year-on-year with a PAT margin of 13.7%. For FY 2021, our revenue declined marginally by 2% to Rs. 2,359 crores with EBITDA margin of 21%. Our PAT of Rs. 292 crores in FY 2021, with a margin of 12.4% grew by 29% year-on-year, mainly due to product mix and saving in selling and administrative expenses. During FY 2021, we generated a cash of Rs. 513 crores from operations and spent Rs. 142 crores in CAPEX and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of March 2021, we have 398 exclusive brand outlets which contribute around 7% of total revenue. Export is holding its ground and contributing around 4% of revenue. During the ongoing crisis, we are undertaking all necessary measures to ensure safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We continue to support and provide assistance to our distributor and customers. Due to lockdown in various parts of India, overall demand for footwear is subdued right now. However, we believe that demand for footwears will bounce back whenever these restrictions are lifted. The second wave of COVID-19 India is more severe and continues to impact lives and livelihood. We stand with all those affected and are dedicated toward protecting and supporting our employees, partners and communities in the face of this unfolding crisis. Relaxo, remains committed towards its stakeholder by creating a sustainable, profitable and growing business. The company enjoys comfortable liquidity position with zero net debt and continues to provide assistance to its distributors and vendors. Despite the uncertainty related to the extent and length of the fresh wave, we believe that company is well placed to emerge stronger in the post COVID- 19 world. We remain committed to give the best experience and value for money to our customer and creating long-term value for our shareholders. We can now open the floor for question. Thank you very much.\n",

And I am taking from our last interaction, at that point in time, obviously, you mentioned that given the trend in raw material prices, you expected longer term margins to sustain at around 18%. But we have obviously ended the year at a much higher number. First, if you could comment, what is it that you expect going forward? Then after which I can come to my next question.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: This year, that is 2021, the margins have been more because we have been saving on account of sales and promotion expenses, travel expenses and some professional expenses and the raw material price also have been benign.

Will it be fair to say that given the disruption that has happened because of COVID, especially in a lot of our MBO channels there has been disruption of other brands which has helped us increase market share, would that be a right sense of what is happening on ground at this point in time?\n",

And when the lockdown starts opening up, only then things will start working. Presently, three out of our eight plants are operating, and maybe 10% - 15% markets are open. So, business is largely affected. So, the way things open up, then we will be able to know how the things take shape. But as far as unorganized/organized is concerned, definitely we are in a better situation than unorganized players, that advantage we might have than others. And as far as our retail outlets are concerned, there our business is hardly 7% - 8%. So, last year also we suffered, a lot of retail outlets were closed. But because we are selling to a lot of multi- brand outlets around 50,000, which are through wholesalers and distributors . So that is our saving grace that we are able to have in our business. That is the way the things are. That advantage we will have this year also.\n",

      "Text: I have a couple of questions. My first question is on the raw materials front. If you look at the gross margins, both on Y-o-Y as well as even on a Q-o-Q basis our gross margins were actually down, because in this quarter we are 56.8%, in the previous quarter they were 58.9%. So, how much is inflation in raw material currently? Because I understand that most of these petrochemical based imports have moved up even in the month of March, April and May. And secondly, how much price increase we have undertaken? And will we be able to sustain gross margins at the current levels? So, that is my question number one, first part of the margins. The second bit on the margin side, if you look last year, we have cut down on our overhead significantly. If I look at full year, they are down by nearly 400 bps, and you are yourself indicating that the ad spend will go up. Now, looking at this scenario that this year supply spend will comeback, raw materials are high, so what sort of outlook on margins would you like to get from here on? So, this is my first question on margins.\n",

      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: The way things are, raw material prices definitely have gone up and are volatile. And this scenario we have faced in our life, a number of times. When the rubber was 100, then it was 250, these things do happen to any business cycle, and we have gone through it. So, what is our strategy? Every quarter, whatever price are, accordingly, we will then take our decision, keeping in view the market condition, price revision is done. So, whatever is required and is possible then we pass it on to our customers. So, this is what we have been doing. Raw material, naturally will always vary. But at the same time, we have to be watchful about competitive intensity in the market. And then you can't just immediately have the kind of knee-jerk reaction to prices and then after three months you may say, okay, now price have gone down so we reduce it. So, there has to be a kind of stability, from our best judgment we pass on the price compared to industry and looking at the competitive intensity, and accordingly take the decision and next quarter again we review the things. So, this is what we have been doing since ages, and this is what we tend to do in future also; Keep on watching the prices, keep on quarterly reviewing the market conditions and accordingly passing on. When margin is concerned, naturally this year things are different, so we have to watch the market conditions and take a decision. The way things are, gross margin may get impacted. But on the overall year basis, we have to wait and see, we can't say now. Accordingly, management also does a course correction in between also. Regarding branding, actually , that is the call we have taken, but then we keep on reviewing all these things. Market is very volatile, raw material or others wise.

Sir, in last three years we have added roughly Rs. 400 crores of turnover, and we have added Rs. 200 crores of EBITDA there, Rs. 193 crores to be precise. Which roughly means that incremental turnover is actually coming at way higher EBITDA margin. And obviously, this year is abnormal, and you said that some of the costs were not there. But in a normal scenario, where would you like this business to operate at, at least for the near term?

But we have been able to achieve around 98% of the previous year. Since the government incentives we have been already in touch with the government authorities, whatever incentives we have been able to avail we are availing. And surely this impact of COVID is happening in this quarter as well because many countries have partial lockdowns or night curfew or complete lockdowns, so we are just having a ‚Äòwait and watch‚Äô and see how the things improve. But the good part is, we have been exporting in our own brand with our standard of quality which is really bringing confidence in the mind of consumer there.

And as far as your question, earlier than last year what was our share, it was 20% because first quarter and second quarter of the previous year were much better than what it was last year. So, this year because sale of slipper was much higher and growth was much more, so the ratio of open footwear went up across footwear. Because today also, throughout the year schools were closed so school shoe sale was not there, people were moving less outdoors so sale was affected, and other article also like tennis shoe, that is again closed footwear, because schools were closed so there were no sale.

And we have to protect that area suppose today you are my customer, I give you certain area, you do with your all-hard work and develop that area, and tomorrow suppose they put another distributor, so how you will feel like? After all, you have nurtured and developed the area, so it is your territory, your responsibility also. Today, if my salespeople go in the market and take orders, whom they will give order to out of the nine, if it is one I will give to that person only, the person who is responsible for that territory.

But from a retailer point of view, you are right, if he has more choices then he also plays between two distributors. Too much cutting of discount, then he expects too much of credit also from each other. That also is a very unhealthy position. As a company, we go to the retailer, we find what difficulties he is facing, then we sort out the way the things are. We don‚Äôt want a distributor should overcharge, and at the same time we don‚Äôt want the retailer should force him to cut too much discount and then both bleed later on. The retailers also many times pass too much discount to the consumer, that also we don‚Äôt want to see. When the retailer doesn‚Äôt turn, he looks back at the distributor, distributor looks at the company.

      "Text: Sir, I just want to understand, has there been an overconsumption situation in FY 2021 for open footwear, which could potentially mean softer demand in FY 2022?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: No, it doesn‚Äôt mean that. You would require slipper always, last year‚Äôs slipper cannot be used this year, after all there is limited life of a product. Anybody requires at least two slippers in a year, so that demand is going to remain. Once the things start opening up consumption will begin, consumption is there even today, even if you are indoor you still require slipper, you are not barefooted, consumption is still there. So, last year consumption cannot affect this year consumption, this is what I want to say.\n",

So, there is no point in just dreaming with those things, what could have happened. But now let us face what the reality is. The reality is, COVID wave is there and things are affected.

Today also we are doing the same thing and putting DMS system on those people, encouraging more-and-more people to become exclusively, our distributors selling our products. Then looking at their areas, territories how we can make them more responsible, how we can make them more efficient, how we can add retailers to them, more of a universe being created. So, it is a never-ending exercise. Even the best things can be made better, so we are always on it. And even today it is an ongoing exercise.\n",

So, by the end of the year how did that change happen? And from FY 2020 to FY 2021, has the premiumization overall increased significantly for us, which should have also aided some gross margins?\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: No, last year was a tough year. Rather, we had to introduce a lot of value for money articles. So, as a result, our receipt per pair average price was lower, more slippers sold, although in the slipper segment we did add premium segments also. But ultimately, because shoe segment was not selling, and in shoe segment we had to introduce value-for-money shoes. So, overall, last year our average selling price came down, although volumes went up.\n",

And it will take time, because it is very confusing and even they are not clear. They used a word; I will just give one example, they say, rubber Hawai Chappal will attract to these things. But nobody makes rubber Hawai Chappal, what is the meaning of it, even they are not clear. When we asked them, what is rubber Hawai Chappal, they are not able to explain. Because these things they have picked up, it was from 20 years back what was happening. So, they are now in talks with us, our industry is talking to them, and they have understood the things.

We may have planned something, but ultimately you have to see the market scenario and decide whether it is a pricing, whether it is brand building, whether it is business promotion expenses, everything we have to see, it is a dynamic environment in which we are operating. You cannot just say it is writing on the wall, you do it like this. If the market dynamics change, we have to change our things also. So, that is a way things move, not that once we plan then we go, we have to see the environment. Environment is dynamic and we have to be flexible accordingly, that is what we will be acting on.\n",

      "Text: No, we can only say, earlier our per capita footwear consumption, guesstimate, 1.5 pair, now this guesstimate is 2 pairs per capita consumption. So, definitely what reflects consumption has gone up only because of this, many people are keeping more pairs than what they were keeping earlier. And as far as the poor man is concerned, those who wear slippers their consumption anytime is two, because one slipper lasts hardly six months, around six months, so he has to buy two pairs. But overall consumption of footwear has gone up because there is a variety, there is fashion. So, because of fashion itself people buy more than one pair, so that is the way consumption has increased.\n",

      "Text: Good afternoon. I am Sushil Batra from Relaxo. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the Q2FY21. We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q2 FY21 financial performance followed by H1FY21 financial performance. In Q2 FY21, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of Rs. 576 crore as compared to Rs. 622 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The drop in Revenue in Q2 is due to disruptions in economic activities caused by COVID-19 pandemic. Benign raw material prices and saving in administrative expenses led to an improvement in the EBITDA margin to 22% as against 16.8% in same quarter last year. Other income stood at Rs. 5 crore as compared to Rs. 2 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase is mainly on account of lease rent waiver/reduction of Rs. 2 crore agreed by lessors for our rented premises. Profit before tax was Rs. 100 crore for the quarter, up by 35% YoY with a PBT margin of 17.4%. Tax expenses for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2020 reflect changes made vide Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019 as adopted by the Company. Therefore, effective tax rate of quarter ended September 30, 2020 is not comparable with previous comparative period of September 30, 2019 as the Company had recognised the full impact of this change in Profit & Loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Profit after tax at Rs. 75 crore for the quarter, is up by 6% YoY with a PAT margin of 13.0%. For First half of FY 2021, we registered a revenue of Rs. 939 crore as compared to Rs. 1,270 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. EBITDA margins increased to 19.6% from 16.6% while PAT margins increased to 10.6% from 9.5% helped by favourable raw material prices. At the end of Sep 30th, 2020, we have 396 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 5% to our H1FY21 revenues. We have added net 6 new stores in this period. Exports are also picking up with opening of markets and are contributing around 4% of revenues. Going forward, we are cautious about the recent rising trend of raw material prices. We would continue our efforts to grow our presence in untapped and under- penetrated markets and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Gaurav Dua\n",
      "Text: After the opening up, northern markets like Delhi was the first one to open up, so in Q2 we saw good demand picking up from the rural India. If you see brand wise, in the close footwear category majorly, there has been impact, but in open footwear we are getting a good demand for the Hawai brand, the Flite brand and the Bahamas. So, there is a good demand coming in open footwear. The second thing is work from home is also happening so there is more demand of open footwear and less for the closed shoes.\n",

      "Speaker: Archana Gude\n",
      "Text: I was just going through your presentation and it suggests that we do not have presence through EBO in Southern India, your comment on this, is that intentional or how you intend to grow in the southern market? Ramesh Kumar Dua : Our purpose of EBO is a little different, strategic one. They are kind of display and exhibition of our products on the sale counters where our purpose is to capture the voice of the consumer and accordingly develop the new products so that we can understand the evolving need of the consumers about our products, the new products that we have launched, so currently we have around 400 outlets, but that is enough to understand the market. But if you want to go to south and west then it is a different thing commercially and then it must make economic sense. Today it is serving us marketing sense, where we understand the market, so from that point of view our objective is being well met with, so currently we do not have any plans to have such kind of outlets in other parts of the country.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",

Any price hike based on genuine input increase is never questioned, it is only when we want to increase the price without any genuine reason then that is questionable, so that is our policy which we have been following in the entire history of Relaxo and we will continue to follow.\n",

Just continuing on the RM and the gross margin EBITDA, we have seen some of the best gross margin being posted in this quarter, I think much better than what we have reported in a very long history, so would be attributed to the crude price collapsing and that come into the benefit and is there any price hike? I think I remember you had about 2%, 3% price hike few months back, is it impacting? and just remind us from what kind of pricing action taken in the last six months or so if you have any and I think gross margins is also not understandable in the sense that the close footwear has been reasonably weak and probably it might have had some impact on the mix as well, so just wanted to understand the gross margins a bit and is there any one off in these numbers.\n",

      "Text: The current situation we are in, things are changing a little. In the first six months, expenses were controlled, other administrative expenses we have controlled. Now when the market will start opening up then we will have to do more expenses on marketing sales promotion, brand building and all that. There was saving on travel expenses, and other administrative expenses also. The raw material also was quite comfortably priced. On the one hand prices of raw material will go up, well travel expenses, marketing and branding will go up as well. So, this what we have achieved in Q2 does not mean it is going to be the norm of the day. We have to be in the market in a competitive manner and accordingly have to take decisions. So as far as third or fourth quarter is concerned, our expenses will be more, so this kind of EBITDA margin should not be expected. Margin will be good, better, but it will be in a more reasonable manner. Let us wait how the raw material prices move which we will come to know in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, whenever some intervention of price increase is required then we will do, we have to review it every quarter, what are the prices of the raw material, other inputs, market scenario, competitiveness of the articles in the market and then we have to take a mature decision on that.\n",

But during this journey we have expanded margins also from 12% to 17%, 18% now and obviously there was a one GST benefit also in between, but just wanted to understand the philosophy what do you benchmark your margins against, is it against the peer or margin is an outcome and you want to be competitive on pricing and you let the margin flow through whatever it comes to, so is it a goal seek in the pricing and margin is an outcome that is not under your control?\n",

First you have to understand what consumer is looking for and we have to first satisfy that need and consumer is looking for what price, so we have to make articles accordingly. And then everything goes back into it and if we are able to serve that need then we are able to expect good margins automatically out of it, but if you supply a fit product, you will not expect those margins at all. Rather sometime you have to sell article at a loss, so we have to always keep close contact, what is, you have already need as a consumer and set right to develop such products only, then only company will remain healthy and we will have better margins. So that lesson we are learning, and we are improving our portfolio accordingly.\n",

      "Text: Good afternoon to everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the financial year 2019-20. We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation, hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q4 FY20 financial performance followed by Full year FY20 financial performance. In Q4 FY20, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of 540 cr down by 15% Year on Year. This impact was mainly due to nationwide lockdown. Due to adoption of IND AS 116, our rental expenses have reduced, and simultaneously depreciation and interest expenses have increased. The total impact of this new accounting standard on EBITDA is an increase of 45.23 cr. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 17.8% vs. EBITDA margin of 15% in Q4FY19. EBITDA margin of 17.8% for Q4FY20 stands at 15.7% without IND AS 116. As informed earlier our Company has chosen to exercise the option of lower tax rate of 25.168% as introduced by the Taxation Laws Ordinance 2019. Our Profit after tax was 52 cr for the quarter, down by 4.8% YoY with a PAT margin of 9.58%. For FY 2020, we registered a revenue of Rs 2410 cr, up by 5% with Gross margin of 56.88% and EBITDA margin of 17%. Favourable raw material prices and premiumization supported this growth. Our PAT of 226 cr in FY20 with a PAT margin of 9.4% grew by 29% YoY mainly due to cost control initiatives in manufacturing excellence and lower tax rates. During FY20, we generated a cash of 319 cr from operation and spent 208 cr in capex and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of 31st March, 2020, we have 390 exclusive brand outlets which contributed 8% to our FY20 revenues. We have added net 47 new stores in this period. Exports have expanded to new territories and is contributing 4% of revenues. During the ongoing crisis, we are undertaking all necessary measures to ensure safety and well-being of our employees and partners. The Company is strictly adhering to Government guidelines and have started operations in plants and offices. Prior to starting of operations, we have developed detailed SOP for safety of its employees. Proper equipment and sanitization material and mask has been provided at all locations. We continue to support and provide assistance to our dealers, distributors and customers. Due to nationwide lockdown overall demand for overall footwear is subdued but demand for open slipper segment has improved during the period. However due to restrictions in manufacturing operations fulfilment of such demand will be a challenge in short term. The Company has paid all long term debts in FY20 and its liquidity position is comfortable. Moreover, with start of business activities the liquidity position of the Company will continue to be comfortable. Relaxo has always been one of the most trusted brands and we believe that the Company is well placed to emerge stronger in post COVID world. We will continue to adopt strategic initiatives to strengthen our brand positioning, improve our product innovation and expansion into newer geographies. We can now open floor to questions. Thank you.\n",

      "Text: Sir just to kind of ask the same question again which other participants have asked, so you touched almost 60% gross margin this quarter and I can see that crude prices have turned even more benign versus where let us say I would assume that you would keep an inventory of three, four months, so the inventories at which probably you will be procuring some of the polymers might have further fallen and that inventory probably will come in your consumption in the next three to four months, so should we expect that margins may improve and you have been indicating that you have been taking some price hikes also, so on a broader basis should this 60% gross margin that you have reported can actually further improve is that a fair expectation in FY2021?\n",

With most of the new ways of SOP setting in the factory, lot of precaution are being taken, social distancing is being maintained, so production capacity of every unit is getting affected, so that is one way we will be raising our cost.

No, the question here is on the gross margin side, so I understand that will impact your operational cost and your employee cost, etc., but purely from a raw material standpoint let us see even if I look at from 1Q FY2020 to 4Q FY2020 you have improved from 54% to 60%, which in a way tells me that the raw material benefits come to you with a lag, but essentially even from a 4Q level the RM prices have declined and RM prices clearly will not have any impact of social distancing, etc., so that was my question is it that you hedge your inventory to some extent and hence some of the benefits may not be there in the future quarter or it is a usual three-month lag, which inventory is kind of get back into your gross margins?\n",

In Q4 you can see there is increase in inventory, there is a less trading good so it has impacted and that is why it looks like there is a big jump in the margin, but that is not the case let us see the full year, which is around 57% that is sustainable again subject to so many things how manufacturing take shape and how material prices cost and then we will take the appropriate action so don‚Äôt get carried away with Q4 results, let us see the full year results and that will be a right indicator of the performance.\n",

      "Text: Rural is picking up like anything because most part of India in rural was not lockdown so there was a constant demand coming from rural, but in the urban India there is lot of problem coming up for example retailer is hardly opening a shop even after government regulation they are not opening the shop, even if they are opening their opening would be for limited timings so rural India is more promising than the urban India so that is what we can see in next one month time. B P Rajesh: That is very helpful. My last question is you were earlier talking about PU being imported and there is a player, which is in the process of putting up capacities do you think that is good for your industry in the sense that hopefully the cost will come down or if you can give some color on that particular event?\n",

Now we have to make what is the demand if more demand is on PU slippers we will make PU slippers more, for example currently Hawai slippers, Bahamas and Flite, EVAs their demand is more so we have focused more on that, but I think you have to know about the prices of raw material. B P Rajesh: My question is that now that a player is setting up the capacity in India itself are you likely to buy from them or do you think the landed price of importing PU is still going to be cheaper?\n",

      "Text: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal 20. We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation, hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q2 FY20 financial performance followed by H1FY20 financial performance. In Q2 FY20, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of 622 cr up by 14.5% Year on Year. This revenue growth was the result of across-the-board performance with our Sparx and Flite, PU, Bahamas categories registering higher growth than other categories. Advantage of price increase took in past helped in the growth of this quarter. This quarter growth is a mix of value and volume growth. Benign raw material prices and increased premiumisation in some categories led to an improvement in the gross margin to 56% as against 53% in same quarter last year. Our employee expenses were 11.6% of revenue and almost similar to that of Q1FY20. The increase in absolute value of employee expenses in Q2FY20 as compared to corresponding period of last year is due to inflationary growth, creation of new position in sales and addition of manpower for our new production capacities. Due to adoption of IND AS 116, our rental expenses have reduced, and simultaneously depreciation and interest expenses have increased. The total impact of this new accounting standard on EBITDA is an increase of 11.8 cr. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 16.8% vs. EBITDA margin of 16.4% in Q1FY20 and 13.5% in Q2FY19. EBITDA margin of 16.8% for Q2FY20 stands at 15% without IND AS 116. Our Company has chosen to exercise the option of lower tax rate of 25.168% as introduced by the Taxation Laws Ordinance 2019. The full impact of this change has been recognized was 71 cr for the quarter, up by 79% YoY with a PAT margin of 11.3%. For First half of FY 2020, we registered a revenue of 1270 cr, up by 15% Gross margin of 55% and EBITDA margin of 16.6%. Favourable raw material prices in FY20 and volume & value mix supported this growth. Our PAT of 120 cr in H1FY20 with a PAT margin of 9.5% grew by 41% YoY. During H1 of FY20, we generated a cash of 160 cr from operation and spent 74 cr in capex and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of Sep 30th, 2019, we have 370 exclusive brand outlets which contributed 7% to our H1FY20 revenues. We have added net 27 new stores in this period. Exports have expanded to new territories and are contributing 4% of revenues. Going forward, we expect raw material prices to remain favourable. We would continue our efforts to grow our presence in untapped and under-penetrated markets and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions.\n",

Highlights of this Q4, revenues increased by 16% to Rs. 636 Crores as compared to last year Rs. 550 Crores. This quarter growth has been mainly driven by increase in volume. EBITDA was at Rs. 95 Crores as against last year Rs. 98 Crores, so corresponding period of the previous year due to higher raw material prices, EBITDA margin in this quarter was 15%. Financial cost stood at Rs. 1.73 Crores. There is a decrease of 29% as compared to last year quarter. PAT was at Rs. 54 Crores as compared to last year quarter Rs. 53 Crores. PAT margin in this quarter was 8.5%. Full year highlights revenue was up by 18% to Rs. 2,292 Crores as compared to last year Rs. 1,949 Crores.

PAT was up by 9% to Rs. 175 Crores as against last year Rs. 161 Crores and margin at 7.6%. Overall our strong execution delivered a good quarter ended the fiscal on a strong note on growth in revenue mainly driven by volume. During the year, the margins were under pressure due to higher raw material prices; however, the impact was contained as we continued to focus on operational efficiency and streamlining product offering in the market. Way forward the imported raw material prices are softening and expected to continue benign. We will continue to adopt strategic initiative to capture expanding market opportunity in and explore geography and drive growth across all segments of our business. We remain committed to strengthening our brand with continuous innovation and accurately assessing customer preference and price positioning, creating, enduring value for our customer and shareholder is the key objective of the business.

Of course, there is the base effect to it, but so my question is that the gross margin side when can we start seeing an uptick in the gross margins? Secondly, on the other expenditure as well as on the employee cost side, we saw a significant jump of almost about 21% and almost 26% in the quarter. If you would just give us a sense to what drove the increase in the cost from the employee side and the other expenditure side?\n",

Regarding employee cost, it is a normal inflation and some positions we created in the system that added to cost but overall it was due to new capacities and additions in the selling department that has increased the cost but it is majorly due to normal inflation.\n",

Again, my question is as far as the strategy is concerned, what I understand as this year, this strategy was clearly driving volumes, sales growth came despite increase in the raw material prices, we were like, we chose growth as compared to the maintaining the margins and other things and now we are seeing that raw material prices have started softening, so can you give first and foremost some sense on what kind of softening we have seen and trend on the EVA pricing front that is part one of the question? Second part is, do we continue to still, as Mr. Dua said, that we have also taken certain price cuts also in this particular year despite raw material prices increasing, so are we going to increase prices, what is our outlook on that particular front?\n",

I just want to ask on your capex and plant, we have seen a rise in the plant and equipment for this year, so is there any particular capex, which has come in and if yes what is that also a reason for dragging the operating expenses up because it would be running at lower utilization as of now.

So is there some because on one direction you are saying that the prices are expected to correct and on the other you held on to high inventory, does that mean that you are setting at a higher inventory and probably in the near term margins could be under pressure?\n",

Lakshminarayana G: If I look at your ASP for FY2018, I do not have the latest number though around Rs.125, Rs.130 per pair that is probably at the lower end of in terms of your competition when I compare it is probably the lowest. So, how does management think about pricing power with the respect to the Sparx brand as well as Flite and are there any product gaps that the management is looking to introduce and take this up a little higher may be in future, is there a plan to get into leather and so on, so if you could talk about something around ASPs and how you think about that whether the pricing power exists especially in the premium brand? Thanks.\n",
      "Sentiment: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
      "Text: Our all brands are meant for different segments. In Sparx brand ASP is more than Hawaii which is meant for the masses and as far as leather is concerned, we do not have any plan to go for leather manufacturing. We have to focus on these brands only and whatever gap in the market, we find, we introduce those products. Lakshminarayana G: If you talk about what you have introduced by the way of new products in the last one-year that would be useful probably?\n",

The Sparx particularly in the sports shoes, lot of article have come in that category also and in Flite, lot of article in Flite PU category which are better priced than other Flite articles. So, this is the way the market is responding and accordingly we are launching the products, so our policy is to launch customers relevant products. Keep on studying the market and accordingly keep on launching the products. Lakshminarayana G: One last question, in your opening remarks, you mentioned something about Flite EVA versus Flite PU, there being some different dynamics at play. If you could just highlight I missed that?\n",

So on that basis, we call these categories. PU is a kind of semi-formal category and EVA is very casual kind of a full lightweight article which you can use in monsoon also and wash and wear kind of category meant for masses also and for medium scale also.

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua\n",
