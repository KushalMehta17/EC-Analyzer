Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Thank you, Sameer. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 and H1 FY25 earnings call to discuss the financial and operational performance of the company. We have already uploaded the earnings press release and the investor presentation on the stock exchange as well as on our website. And we hope that you have had an opportunity to go through them. Before we begin the question and answer session, let me quickly go through some of the highlights of Q2 and H1 FY25 performance, beginning with Q2. Revenue from operations in Q2 FY25 was at INR 679 crores as compared to INR 715 crores in Q2 FY24, a decline of 5% year-on-year. This is mainly due to weak market demand during the quarter. Our EBITDA for the quarter was at INR 88 crores as compared to INR 92 crores in the corresponding quarter in the previous year. The company maintained its EBITDA margin at 12.9% during the quarter as compared to 12.8% in Q2 FY24, despite the subdued demand. PAT was at INR 37 crores as compared to INR 44 crores reported in Q2 FY24. PAT margin for Q2 FY25 stood at 5.4% as compared to 6.2% in Q2 FY24. Higher depreciation in the quarter has impacted the profitability of the company. Now moving to our H1 FY25 performance. In H1 FY25, we recorded a revenue of INR 1,428 crores, EBITDA was at INR 187 crores compared to INR 199 crores in the same period of last year. EBITDA margin was at 13.1% as compared to 13.7% in H1 FY24. PAT for H1 FY25 stood at INR 81 crores against INR 101 crores in H1 FY24. PAT margin was at 5.7% as compared to 6.9% in H1 FY24. The company has incurred a capex of INR 49 crores till 30th September '24. Our company continues to be net debt free and supported by positive cash flow from operations. Our company is in process of adding new distributors and focusing on to improve retail network through various initiatives. Further in line with our continued focus on cost efficiencies, we are performance in the future. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.994)

Text: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question is from the line of Videesha Sheth from Ambit Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Videesha Sheth 
Text: My first question was on the commentary that you made in the press release regarding consumers down-trading to lower price on organized competition and your call to not dilute prices. So how do you see that impacting volumes and market share in the near term? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.993)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Hi. This is Gaurav. We are seeing a pretty poor footfall happening across the country what we have noticed. And there is a mushrooming of local players, the unorganized players, new and new unorganized players have also come into the play. So there was a pressure on us to reduce the prices which we have not. And we are in process of adding more retailers and distributors to counter that. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Videesha Sheth 
Text: So Gaurav, where I'm coming from is that during FY23 also when we faced a lot of pressure from RM inflation. We chose to increase prices, but we also then lost market share due to that. So do you see this call of not diluting or reducing prices affecting volumes as well or impacting our market share in that way? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Temporarily, we can say, yes. But in long term, I think we will be able to gain back the market share. It's because of 2 factors. There is poor footfalls, demand is also subdued and the raw material prices, all these things, because of multiple factors, they were able to enter. But I think now the wedding season, we are hearing like quarter 3, a lot of weddings are happening, there will be a demand uptake in the market and things will improve. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Videesha Sheth 
Text: Got it. And the second question was if you can share your observations on the channel inventory and some granular sense on consumption trends as well, while there is overall weakness, but if you could break it down into how we are seeing the move in rural versus urban and also the competitive landscape? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.964)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Channel inventory, we are maintaining, there is an increase in the inventory as compared to March. So it has increased due to subdued demand. And inventory, we are carrying almost in GT and new channel at the same level, but retail, it has increased a little bit. So overall, there is an increase on inventory front. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Videesha Sheth 
Text: Got it. And my last question is what would be your outlook for margins versus the earlier guidance of 15% to 16% for FY25? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.582)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: I think company is taking a lot of steps to improve the margins. On the back-end front, we are working very closely with the manufacturing how to really improve our productivity and add on to our margins. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: The next question is from the line of Shirish Pardeshi from Centrum Broking. about 6% to INR 156 and the number of pair sold is lower. So I do understand there is a demand issue and other things. But is there any regional variation because we have a larger business coming from North. Is the difference between North and South and West and East is different in terms of this demand situation? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.965)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: See, across India, we are seeing this issue of demand not being optimum. But East, if you talk about, East is most affected. So payments are very slow coming from Eastern markets. So East is the market which has been mostly affected. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.989)

Speaker: Shirish Pardeshi 
Text: Okay. So we have been saying that we are trying to, in fact, improve the mix towards the premium end also. Any color, any mix you would be able to highlight at this point of time? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Status quo. Our prices were more because we revised the prices in January. This is the effect of higher ASP. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Shirish Pardeshi 
Text: Okay. Okay. And in terms of Sparx contribution, would you specify how we should look at in second half? Because you said that you are focusing on the distribution angle also. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Sparx, I think we are able to maintain the momentum in Sparx compared to the other open footwear. So I think Sparx should definitely be better off compared to other 2 brands, that is Flite and Bahamas. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Shirish Pardeshi 
Text: Okay. So I assume that the first half, the situation demand down trading, regional competition, local competition, if the status quo is there, how we should be looking at second half? Because even second half was -- the base is benign at this point of time. But does last 30, 40 days give you some confidence that we will be able to recoup our volume growth? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Currently, like in October or whatever, you can see the start, we have not seen a great start. So we are hoping that because of this November-December having a huge number of weddings, so demand should improve. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: The next question is from the line of Prerna Jhunjhunwala from Elara Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: Just wanted to check on closed footwear performance now that we've added capacity in last year. So has the mix change taken place in the first half and second quarter? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.97)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So it's same like what it was the last year and last quarter. There's not much of a change happening there. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: So what is your strategy to improve our mix towards closed footwear? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.676)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Strategy we talked about, again, it is like appointment of distributor, adding more channels, for example, e-commerce. We were a little slow this time because of too much of ask from Flipkart and Amazon. So we are very cautious and then we are taking steps to improve our reach in Sparx. conservative demand is also weak and you're expecting improvement in demand coming forward in the quarters to come. So how should we see the growth coming in for you? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So we are really cautious of the market. And what we see is we have to grow, like we are appointing more distributors across territories. And we are hoping that we can grow around 8% to 10% in Sparx category. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: Okay. And overall revenue growth that you're targeting? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Difficult to say as of now, but definitely it should be positive. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: Okay. And what would be the distributor and retail reach increase for you in the next 2 years for both open footwear and closed footwear? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: See it's a continuous process. We keep on adding distributors. So it is a continuous process. So adding retailers, like if you see 2 years back, we were at 55,000. Now we are at 70,000 retailers. So, it's a continuous activity, continuous process. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: We can assume the same run rate to continue? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Yes, definitely. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: The next question is from the line of Sameer Gupta from IIFL Securities. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: I noticed that there is an ASP increase of 6%. I mean, I heard that you mentioned that you've taken a revision of price in January, but even from last quarter onwards, this is an increase of around 3%. So just wanted to understand is there a change in mix that is impacting this and some more color on this? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: See, we have introduced premium categories in some of our brands. And because of that, there is an effect of increase in ASP, plus we have taken a price increase in the January in Hawaii category. And last year, the base level was also a little lower. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: Okay. But there is no price increase as such taken in this quarter? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: No, no, we have not taken price increase. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: Got it, sir. Sir, second question on this competitive intensity increasing. What is the trigger for this? Has there been a sharp fall in raw material prices that has resulted in this intensity going up? And how is the company going to counter it? I mean, let's say, it continues for a few more quarters. So do you have a strategy in place to counter it at some point? Or do you keep waiting because it's unsustainable and it will go away at some point in time? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So you're absolutely right because of lower raw material prices, a lot of new competitors have come in. We are working with our marketing team to devise a new portfolio, a new portfolio strategy, so how to counter them. So we are working on cost optimization plus adding new is happening. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.962)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: And is there a role of the BIS compliance also in this that the smaller players don't have to comply as of now? Is that also impacting? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, that could be a reason because all small manufacturers, they are exempt from Quality Control standards. So whatever quality they want to produce, they can downgrade and they can cause unethical competition also otherwise. So that also has some role. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.981)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: Got it, sir. Lastly, sir, if I may squeeze in. The other expenses have seen a decline of 3%. Just wanted to understand the broad constituents, which is resulting in this. And also, let's say, the volume growth comes back, do you see this growth in other expenses also coming back? Or this INR 220 crores number odd is the ballpark, which is here to stay? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Other expenses, we took a very calculated call. We have just reduced the advertisement expenses in this period as compared to last year. So that is the major item, which has come down. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: But do you see this going up going forward if demand comes back? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Yes. Next year, definitely. Not this year. Next year, definitely, we will review, and we may go back to the original percentage spend. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: So FY25, what is the number that you're targeting for ad spend, full year? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Generally, we used to spend around 4%. So this year, we have just thought about 3%, 1% lower than last year. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: The next question is from the line of Gaurav Jogani from JM Financial. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Apologies for the earlier, sir. And my question is with regards to the impact of BIS. I mean, while in the shorter term because these smaller players are given a relaxation of not complying with the norms. But on longer term, how do you see the norms impacting the industry on an overall basis and Relaxo specifically? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Government has actually given exemption to the small industry for the time being. It doesn't mean they're going to go on always. That we have to wait and see how they see. But as far as we are concerned, we are strictly following quality control standard prescribed by Bureau of the Indian Standards. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Yes. So because you guys are following the quality standards prescribed by the agency, then can you be marketing your products as a better quality product and hence, they do ISI or BSI mark. So can there be marketing angle that benefit guys at the value end who are following these norms? Is there a case for that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.6)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, no, on the long term, this will benefit the company. In the short term because of there's a market down trading, people are not having enough money in their hands, so they are going for the quality products that we are following. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.984)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: The next question is from the line of Prerna Jhunjhunwala from Elara Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: I wanted to understand the capex for the year. What will be the full capex for FY '25 and '26? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: FY25, already we have spent around INR 50 crores. So, it will be again in the range of INR 50 crores to INR 60 crores in next half. So, total will be INR 100 crores plus in this full year. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: And what is it going to be spent on, INR 100 crores? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: This majorly we have spent upon the regular items, which we spent around INR 25 crores to INR 30 crores. Then we are adding some machineries and some civil work also. So it's a mix of all these. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: Okay. Okay. Can we assume any capacity addition in this? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra

Text: The next question is from the line of Ankit Kedia from PhillipCapital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Sir, when you say October has been a slow month for you and you're hopeful for November, already primary sales for November would have been done now, and you would be generating demand for the next month. So are we seeing pressures in primary demand from distributors and they're sitting on high stock? And if you could answer separately for open footwear and closed footwear? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.979)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So it is same for both open and closed footwear. Still, we are hoping that next 2 months should be better compared to what has happened last quarter. So because of poor footfalls, these things are happening. So it would be gradual. It cannot be just immediate the things will change. Ankit Kedia And sir, are we facing pressure from organized players as well like Walkaroo and Aqualite who have also become aggressive in the open footwear category? Or it's not from the unorganized only what you called out? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: They are also facing challenges from unorganized. I think, they are also facing a lot of issues compared to BIS of unorganized players, lower footfalls. For full industry, it is the same. Ankit Kedia And sir, 3 quarters back, last year when we had lost market share, you alluded that you go for market share gains and not for margins. And now again, as a strategy, you're going for margins and not for market share gains. So what is the long-term thought process of the company on top line growth versus margins? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: No, we're taking a balanced approach. It cannot be one way. It cannot be only margin or only sales. We have to take a long-term view and take a balanced approach. brand as well. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. On the long term, we have to see the thing. Our strategy has to be not based on what currently we are going through. We have to make quality product, and we have to sustain the things. We are adding distributors. We are adding retailers. We have introduced a retail app, our connect with the retailer is improving. And this base is improving of our retailers. Our reach improves, definitely, the sale will also improve. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Sir, can you separately call out the growth in the North market versus the West and South, if possible? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.881)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Can you repeat it please? Ankit Kedia Can you just let call out the revenue growth or the volume decline in North versus ex. North region? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: There has been just a marginal 1% drop in some areas sustained in the West and South. So basically East, we have seen a little more dip compared to other regions. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: The next question is from the line of Aditya Khetan from SMIFS Institutional Equities. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aditya Khetan 
Text: Yes. Sir, my first question is on to the volumes part. Sir, in H1, we had seen that the volumes have declined by almost around 5% as compared to the last year of H1. And sir, you have also stated that the muted demand and all, and you are hopeful for a good wedding season. Sir, so any guidance on to the full year volume side, if you can share, so whether we can see a positive growth or it would be flattish? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: It would be flattish because it will take time to cover up the 6-month sales and volume loss. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.978)

Speaker: Aditya Khetan 
Text: Okay. Okay. And sir, despite facing this muted demand, sir, so when we look at the operational metrics, like your gross profit per pair and EBITDA per pair. So that has gone up on a sequential basis by around so 3% to 4%. I wanted to know, is there any component of the better product mix which we have seen in this quarter?. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: EBITDA is by and large same in the first quarter, second quarter if you compare to last year's first quarter and second quarter, total H1, H2, just a 0.5% difference of EBITDA. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.989)

Speaker: Aditya Khetan 
Text: Got it. On the gross profit, sir, we have seen a good improvement. Any comments over there? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Growth, definitely, there are 3 reasons for this. We took a price increase in January, so that is the advantage has come in the system. Raw materials has also, I think, eased out. And third is, if you see the percentage, there is an increase of inventory, so that percentage is, I think, 1% looks better than the last year. So these are the 3 reasons. So one is the price increase; second, raw material advantage; third, that is the accounting part. You can see there is an increase of inventory of around INR 47 crores in this, that includes a conversion cost also. That's why that margin looks better. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jasmine 
Text: I wanted to understand your comment on reduction of the A&P cost. My understanding is that the demand is muted, the local players are kicking in. So what is the rationale of reducing our A&P spend when this time, I believe there should be more spend to garner more market share and hence increase the volume and sales? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So what we have done is we have reduced in advertisement but increased on schemes in sales and promotion. So because of trade, push is required for an immediate scenario, so we have increased our schemes expenditure. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Text: The next question is from the line of Sachee Trivedi from Trident Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: Okay. Great. This is Sachee Trivedi from Trident Capital Investments. My question is slightly more longer-term oriented. Now in the last 2, 3 years, we have seen 2 things happening: one is the shift of demand from open to closed footwear. And the second is a shift of demand from probably the physical channels to online channels. How did you not see this coming? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: There were multiple factors. Like, for example, nobody saw that there will be such poor footfalls, leading to poor payments from the retailers. So it's very difficult to really gauge how the monsoon will come up, how election will what will be the result of that. And plus a lot of unorganized players coming up because of BIS issue. Like we never thought that government will give them a leeway you can enrol after a year. So many things you cannot predict how the things will operate, how government will come with the new policies. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: Those are like monsoon and election and BIS, I think these are very I mean, I don't think that is frankly, the crux of this. We are talking about a very structural, a very secular shift in demand from open to closed footwear. You look around yourself, there's I mean people are wearing shoes, those athleisure sports shoes. And there is a very structural shift on to online. In fact, online players are having disruption from being from e-commerce to quick commerce and whatnot. So there is a massive disruption happening in channel. Given how widespread you are, given how many contact points, retail points you had, I am surprised that you did not catch on to the changes, the tectonic shift, the structural changes that are happening in the industry? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. As for that, there's a conflict of channel, general trade versus online channel. There is also too much of discounting pressure on online channel. So strategically, we are there, but we have to be very cautious of our general trade. Our multi-brand outlet, they get suffered when they see too much of discount. This year, we had to actually say no to Flipkart and Amazon because they generally give too much discount and that affects us. So we have to be very cautious in the changing scenario. Things are conflicting. They're very complex also. kind of conflicting and not complementary but sometimes totally opposite. Whatever we think about the general trade, that affects our e-commerce. And when we look for only for e- commerce, then heavy discounting, the sale may go up, but on the long term, our general trade gets affected. So we are grappling with this issue and trying to create a separate range for e- commerce, so that this conflict should get minimized. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.739)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: And plus, consolidation will happen. Now this year, maybe last 2 years, you can see in online, there are multiple new brands have come up in footwear. Like earlier it was 20 brands, now they are more than 200 brands in footwear. So consolidation will happen. Now discount war will be controlled, like a lot of things are happening in online, yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: And our two-third business is open footwear, which will never go on e-commerce. Price is low price, masses article. It is not profitable to work on e-commerce on all these masses articles. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.964)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: So this disruption because of the online is something to be not taken likely because we are seeing industry after industry being disrupted and completely changed and transformed because of this. Do you feel that this could have a struck, I mean, given your very, very rich experience over decades, do you think this is probably the biggest challenge that you are facing now simply because a shift in nature of demand. And the channel of demand is causing and has allowed a lot many competitors, whether it is people who are coming today and selling maybe for 1 season and going away. But all of a sudden, they have the shelf space that they could never get in physical retail industry. And we are seeing in cosmetics, we are seeing in beauty products, new age players are coming up. They have gained enough critical mass and the old legacy players are really suffering in volumes. Do you think this is the kind of challenge that you are facing? And I'm curious to hear how you place this challenge, the size of this challenge to everything you have seen in the decades of experience that you have? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.527)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: So no doubt, things are challenging. We are also mindful of the situation what is unfolding. But we have to see, we have to balance between general trade and e-commerce. In e-commerce, we can't, at the cost of general trade, promote e-commerce. E-commerce, we are mindful. We have started selling as brand as a seller where we can control our pricing also. Earlier, we were selling directly to Flipkart and other distributors, there was no price control, which was affecting our general trade. So we are building our own brand as a seller and trying to sell direct to the consumer and watchful of the situation so that we can co-exist in the general trade also and e-commerce also. And also two-third of the articles that we manufacture, they are meant for the masses. And these masses articles, they are not viable to sell on e-commerce. We have to do that business through general trade only. masses. Now these people are probably not going online also. Why has there been no growth in this masses category over the last almost 3 years now? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.99)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, no. After all, market in open footwear, closed footwear is there. But in the general trade, in the 2 years, the demand has been low. And now in this year, you find a lot of unorganized, low- price articles have entered the market. There is a problem of money in the hand of the masses segment at the moment, what we are witnessing. That is why they are trying to go for cheaper alternatives. But on the long-term, quality articles will also be the aim of the company and that will only help the company. We can't go for reducing the quality or do anything just for the time being. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: Okay. And actually, if you don't mind, I saw that you have tied up with Disney and Marvel. Does it mean you are going to have some focus on the children's segment? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. That will help in the premiumization of our articles which are meant for children and others also. So we have done a slow beginning. But in the coming times, this will help us improve the ASP of the company. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Text: The next question is from the line of Devanshu Bansal from Emkay Global. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: Sorry, I've joined the call late, so please pardon me if I'm repeating anything that has been answered before. Sir, I just wanted to check on your remarks that the industry has sort of witnessed an increase in lower priced unorganized competition. So firstly, I wanted to check what exactly is this unorganized competition. So earlier during this entire calendar year, the imports from China, etcetera, were on a decline. But now over the last couple of months, I guess, the imports of such articles have seen an increase. Are you referring to this? Or are you referring to all those smaller-scale MSMEs that are operating from India and they have suddenly increased the competitive intensity in that space? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Yes, it's actually both. Plus 2 years back, there was a change of GST from 5% to 12%. Since then, like a lot of new players or unorganized competitors have come up. There are multiple reasons for that. One is the lower-priced raw material. When the raw material price goes down, definitely new players come in. And the price goes up, they really vanish. Plus, definitely, we can talk about these are regional players, which have been having no brand, not paying GST. They don't have BIS compliance. So they are taking some market share. And there are a lot of imports happening, like what you were saying about China imports, it has not reduced, but it has increased because government have allowed them until September to import product. After that, they cannot because then the BIS will be applicable. So multiple factors, not one or two. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.5)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: Understood, sir. And secondly, I just wanted to understand from your balance sheet perspective, the inventory levels are sort of up by about 10% odd. So any specific reason for that? demand, that's why inventory has increased. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: Okay. I just wanted to check because this time around, this festive season has been early. Despite that, the inventory levels are up and receivables are down. So I just wanted to check. I mean, is it like some demand levels in festive also sort of remaining low? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: So far demand has been subdued, even in the month of September and October. We are hopeful that November onwards things will improve. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: The next question is from the line of Lavita from Mirae Asset. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Lavita 
Text: I have 2 questions. So with respect to how we are positioned in the market, are we seeing any portfolio gaps in the open or closed footwear category since we have seen Crocs being successful last 2, 3 years? The way customers preferences have changed towards more comfort wear and fashion wear. So are we looking at newer categories in any of these open and footwear space? And second question. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Continue, please continue. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Lavita 
Text: Okay. So my second question is towards marketing strategies. Are we looking at any differentiated marketing strategy because we see the high-end brands have a different appeal towards the young millennials and customers? So what's your take on that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So we are in touch with the market constantly. And we are always aligning our portfolio with the market. For example, like from basic slipper, people are moving to colored and printed slippers. So we are going to launch, whatever the gaps in the portfolio, we are at constant touch with the market and giving product accordingly. Secondly, about our marketing strategy, definitely, the way world is moving, we are also moving from offline to online advertising. So we are doing a lot of branding in the digital space now. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Lavita 
Text: So I wanted to understand more on the specific categories. Is there a trend that is where we have not looked at? Is there something, any space in any particular category that we have not looked at and we are approaching towards it? And in terms of marketing, more towards different message that we can, a unique way of marketing strategy apart from being there online, which everybody else is? That's all. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So when you talk about the product gaps or portfolio gaps, like definitely, marketing is shifting from sportswear to athleisure. So we are in touch with the market, be it people are going for chunky soles or different color, different design. So we keep on doing this analysis and introduce products accordingly. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Now sneakers at the moment. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Yes, the sneakers, like you know the sneaker trend is there. The street fashion is there. So we are in line with the market trend and launching products accordingly. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: My question is, sir, in India, there is a lot of footwear parks that are being created in Tamil Nadu, right, where all large Taiwan-based players are entering the space. Haryana is a state also has similar advantage from a cost of labor perspective, the footwear industry is quite well established in the state. Any thoughts around this incremental Make In India opportunity that is emerging? So your comments on that please. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: So in Tamil Nadu, whatever manufacturers, they are coming there from Taiwan. They are making for multinationals. And mostly they are making and then exporting. So that is not going to affect our domestic market in that manner so far. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: I wanted to check if we can also sort of explore as in utilizing our facilities in the lean period for such demand that may be there? Any thoughts around that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we have to see what is required by Indian market, Indian consumer and what kind of the masses consumer that we have. How we have to address their needs. So we are developing our article as per the needs of our customers, and we are aligning that, value for money or quality, whatever affordable quality we can provide. That's what we are focusing on. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: Understood. And sir, there were some news reports, thought it was not wide, but there were some news reports on this GST being reduced from 12% to 5%, right, for footwear. So any thoughts around that? Any representations being a leader that you have made to the government because there has been a lot of disruptions, right, because of this unorganized lower price competition that is there, any thoughts on this thing? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.901)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, representation by the industry is being made regularly at regular intervals. Currently also, industry has taken up this matter with the government authorities. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: Any expectation, sir, from that perspective... 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Government would never commit. These things, you can only make representation. And then we have to wait.

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: The next question is from the line of Sameer Gupta from IIFL Securities. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: Sir, just a follow-up. The separate portfolio for e-commerce that you have mentioned, any timeline that you can share by when do you expect to launch this? And is it going to be margin dilutive because this is being done primarily to bypass the e-commerce channels, discounting nature and its effect on GT? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.697)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So we have already bifurcated the online portfolio, e-commerce portfolio. Now second question is about the margin dilution. So we are not going to dilute our margins in that category. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: Then sir, how does it address the issue, which is basically the online players discounting and that affecting the channel? How does it affect that issue? I mean if we are not going to participate, then how is the separate portfolio going to help? offering huge discounts. Other small activities or any other days, we will be there. Our only thing is to protect the interest of both channels. We have to see about the brand also, at what level we can give discount. And it should be in concurrence with us, how they decide the discounting policy. It cannot be wherever they want, they can give what kind of discount they can offer like. So we are focusing on more of BAS, branded as a seller, compared to giving outright sale to them. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: Agreed. But when this separate portfolio, you will still be brand as a seller. You're not going to outright sell to the Flipkarts and Amazons. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: In that scenario, it depends upon what will be the discounting philosophy of that brand. For example, Flipkart, we will not participate when the higher discounting are happening. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: And how does it work? So the discount is borne by the Flipkart and Amazon? Or it's kind of shared between you and... 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: See, on the special days like Big Billion Day or Amazon Festival, they give from their side without taking any approval from us or sitting together and deciding the price. So they just, whatever they feel like, they give discounts. So we do not appreciate like this kind of discounting practice. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to protect our general trade also. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: But, sir, if the portfolio is bifurcated, it will protect, right? I mean I'm not able to understand this. So I understand the brand image part. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: So we have to be mindful of both the things. General trade, once you make the articles separate, okay, that thing is there. But still, we have to be mindful of how we have to manage both the channels and about the brand image, what kind of discounting we want to allow. We have to balance out all these things and take a very cautious move. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: Got it, sir. Second question, and I heard this during the course of the call that BIS for smaller players, you mentioned that a leeway of 1 year has been given, but my understanding was that right now, there is no such deadline to comply for small and micro enterprises. Just wanted your clarification on this, sir. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: This is what only the minister declared. But how they will do it, there is no writing on it. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: Got it. So officially, there is no such deadline. The Minister has said is what you're referring to. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: That was, he said our intention is that everybody has to comply, but for the time being, these small players are being exempted. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our Q4 and full year FY24 Earnings Call to discuss the financial and operational performance of the company. We have already uploaded the earnings press release and the investor presentation on the stock exchanges as well at our website and hope that you have had the opportunity to go through those. Before we begin the question-answer session, let me quickly go through the Q4 and FY24 performance, starting with Q4. During Q4FY24, we recorded revenue of Rs. 747 crores as compared to Rs. 765 crores in Q4FY23, reporting a marginal decline of 2.3% year-on-year on account of slight decline in volumes. EBITDA for the quarter was at Rs. 120 crores, up by 2% year-on-year from Rs. 118 crores in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. EBITDA margins were up marginally by 69 basis points and stood at 16.1% in Q4FY24 as against 15.4% in Q4FY23. PAT was at Rs. 61 crores as compared to Rs. 63 crores reported in Q4FY23. PAT margin for Q4FY24 remained flat at around 8.2%. Now coming on the full year FY24. We have achieved a moderate growth of 4.7% year-on-year from Rs. 2,783 crores in FY23 to Rs. 2,914 crores in FY24. This performance was largely driven by a significant uptick in open footwear volumes, a witness to the efficacy of our strategic initiatives to regain market share. EBITDA for the year was at Rs. 407 crores as against Rs. 336 crores in FY23, registering a growth of 21.1%. EBITDA margin was at 14%, improved by 188 basis points year-on-year as against 12.1% in FY23. Margins majorly benefited from the softening of raw material prices, which was partially offset by the increased fixed costs. PAT was at Rs. 200 crores in FY24 as compared to Rs. 154 crores in FY23, recording a significant growth of 29.8%. PAT margin was 6.9% during FY24 against 5.6% in FY23, improving by 133 basis points year-on-year. In FY24, the company incurred a total CapEx of Rs. 248 crores, including a purchase of 30-acre land parcel in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, worth Rs. 127 crores. We remain a net debt-free company recognition. We continue to explore new avenues and focus on other new channels and e- commerce platforms for growth. We are confident that our ongoing efforts will lead to favourable results for us in the future. Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you very much. We will now begin with the question-and-answer session. First question is from the line of Shirish Pardeshi from Centrum Broking. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Shirish Pardeshi 
Text: Just two questions in the beginning. This 5 crores pieces what we have sold in Q4 against 5.1 crores in the Q1. So can you give some more colour what segment, which segment and which markets is driving this? And something more on the inventory side, is the inventory is now under control in the field? Or do you think it will take some more time? And the second question is on the pricing bit. What kind of pricing aspiration we will hold or we will continue the similar price over FY ‘25? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Yes. This is Gaurav. Just to answer your question. Q4, when we started, there was a QC order, BIS was implemented. So if you see that subdued growth or a little minus coming in, that the main reason was that we were implementing BIS. So there was some confusion in the market, how it will be implemented. So we increased price marginally. And then we saw that we were able to implement all this BIS. And what is the second question? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Shirish Pardeshi 
Text: I think the growth, what we have seen in a number of pairs. So Q1 was 5.1 and Q4 has come back to 5 crores. So any colour on what kind of growth we are seeing in number of pairs, which is now remained at 5 crores on an average? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: No, our month January was affected because of BIS. That's why we're not able to cover that, we could not cross that 5.1 crores figures. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.732)

Speaker: Shirish Pardeshi 
Text: If the similar trend has continued? And the question was, the parallel question was that whether the inventory is now adjusted or normalized or still there will be some effect, which can be seen in Q1? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So inventory is now normalized. There's no problem with inventory. And I think now the things have started picking up in the market. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Shirish Pardeshi 
Text: Okay. And the second question is that in terms of pricing aspiration, what should we look in FY '25 is the price increases will happen? Or will remain as where we are? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The pricing depends upon our cost of the inputs. If the input remains stable, then prices also remain stable. So by and large, we have to make sure we are always competitive in the markets, keeping that thing in view, we have our pricing strategy. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.885)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Next question is from the line of Devanshu Bansal from Emkay Global. is the expected increase in the capacity with this new addition? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Capacity utilization is around 65%. And on the land parcel that we have bought, we have to always stay ahead of the curve where land searching is always time-consuming. So for future growth, we have land in our hand. So whenever we want to increase production, then we have to start the process of building the factory because we are always having greenfield projects. And then we take steps accordingly. So that is something keeping future in view that we have acquired this land. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: Understood, sir. And a follow-up to this is, there is a lot of substandard open footwear being imported as of now, which should, in my opinion, at least be restricted after BIS implementation. So is this capacity expansion somewhat factoring in restricted imports from other countries? Which may sort of lead to higher demand from local players like Relaxo? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.767)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Earlier also before implementation of BIS, the product category we were in by and large our Hawaii segment, nothing was imported. It is only where footwear industry was not able to make that kind of products, they were being imported. Now after this kind of restriction, definitely some shoes, some EVA slippers their import will be restricted. Particularly low quality the EVA slipper were being imported. So there will be a restriction on that. Indirectly, we may have some benefit. Let us wait and see. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: Yes, sir. That's what I'm trying to ask. So is this benefit going to be large in quantum? Or is it just a small benefit that can come to a place like Relaxo? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.984)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I don't think it is going to be very large. Overall import was hardly 5%-6% of the Indian consumption. That is going to be restricted. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.827)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: Understood, sir. And one last question is our ROE is currently at 8%-10% over the last 2 years. So how do you see these levels? And any trajectory that you would like to sort of highlight in the initiatives that the company is taking to improve this? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: ROE definitely because the profits were under pressure in the last 2-3 years. So that's why it has come down, and we have added more assets in the system. So, from next year or in coming time growth will be there. So it will improve definitely. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Devanshu Bansal 
Text: Okay. Last, sorry, final bookkeeping question is, sir, while revenues have grown by about only 4%-5% in this year, the receivable increase is about 30-odd percent. Is this something a one-off? Or why is this number increased at FY24 end? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: This has increased because there is a pressure in the market. The demand is subdued. So because of pressure in the market, there is an increase of the outstanding. So the payments are slow, you can say, the payment is slow in the market. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.993)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Next question is from the line of Prerna Jhunjhunwala from Elara Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: See, as you see, the sports segment is growing faster than the open footwear category. But last year, what we have seen is that open has grown more than the closed footwear, sport shoes. So the industry, if you talk about 3 to 4 years' time. Sports footwear or closed footwear will definitely exceed in growth compared to the open footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: Okay. And what are our current capacities if you see the breakup of the two? And what is the revenue share of the two segments? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: See, as company Relaxo as a whole, our closed footwear contributes 20%, and open footwear contributes 80%. But one of the brand, which is Sparx, there, it is 60% closed and 40% open. So we are trying to grow this category - Sparx, which has more contribution of closed footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.944)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: Okay. And why was closed footwear under pressure this year? I did not understand that part? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.958)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So that is because of the demand. A lot of new entrants have come in the market and the price what they are offering. But there's more supply than demand in the last 2 years. A lot of capacity has been put-in by the other players. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.555)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: Okay. So you mean there is an oversupply of product in the market? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.914)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Local players are there, yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: So you see that oversupply correcting in how much time? Is it fair to ask, I mean, understand that? Or it will be on market forces? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.724)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: It depends on the market. It's dependent on the market. But consolidation will happen definitely. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: Okay. And will you please help us understand the brand-wise revenue share as well? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Already we have shared in our investor presentation, but even then, I can tell you. So Relaxo, it's contributing, Relaxo with Bahamas, 25%. And then Sparx and Flite both are equal, so 25% Relaxo plus Bahamas and rest 50-50 Sparx and Flite. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: Okay. So Relaxo and Bahamas 25%, Flite 25%? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Sparx is 37%. So 50% of 75 divided by 2, 37.5% roughly half-half. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Next question is from the line of Videesha Sheth from Ambit Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Videesha Sheth 
Text: My first question is on the market share. In 2Q, you had mentioned about gaining market share that was lost in FY '23. So any comments on how market share has moved in the second half of the year? That is my first question. our volume growth is more than the value growth. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Videesha Sheth 
Text: Okay. So on a value basis, market share would have increased? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Yes, Correct. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Videesha Sheth 
Text: Got it. And the second question was we've always been talking about increasing our agency and presence in the south of India. So any incremental initiatives that are being undertaken to increase the share from that region? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.993)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So we have implemented DMS across India. So DMS has been implemented throughout. Now we have launched the app. So this is a retailer app. We are doing engagement with the retailer now. So with the help of the app, we are able to touch 50,000 outlets. So 50,000 outlets have downloaded this app. So there is a direct connect from company to the retailer now. So if you talk about South, last year, there was a little decline in sales. There was pressure in the market. So we are just trying to maintain that market share. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.485)

Speaker: Videesha Sheth 
Text: Okay. And essentially, this app that we're talking about, would that largely help from a demand, from a more accurate demand forecasting perspective? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.959)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Correct. A lot of things. We can even pass on the gifts to the retailer directly. We'll try to, we'll understand what is the market demand and which outlets are demanding what, what is the market share of this outlet? A lot of data will come through that.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: My question was mainly regarding the revenue, which has been flattish for the last three years. What kind of revenue projections you can model for this? And you have talked about the industry growing at, I mean, not industry, the footwear market size growing by around 15%-17% in next year. So our growth has been 3%-4%. You are projecting the market size to be around, growing at 15%-17%. What kind of projections we can go ahead with?

We have also, through BAS - Brand As Seller and e-commerce platform selling direct-to- consumer. So all this information, which we'll gather through all these three apps will be kind of a big source of knowing market what is what. And all these combined efforts will help us penetrate and grow better in the coming time. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.99)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tanmay Gupta 
Text: Sir, I just wanted to understand. The revenue declined 2% in this quarter and gross margins improved to 60%. Is that because of the high sales in closed footwear for the quarter? Is my understanding right? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So the sales were not high, open footwear was more, if you talk about sales. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Tanmay Gupta 
Text: So sir, I just wanted to understand where the gross margin lever is coming from? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tanmay Gupta 
Text: Right. So sir, I just wanted to understand the strategy in increasing our closed footwear penetration because, as you said, a lot of unorganized peers have also come up. And we have, obviously, the competition from the organized. So looking going forward, are we, how will we penetrate the footwear, the closed footwears footprint in the market? And with the price range or premiumization or what kind of strategy if you can, little bit tell me? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.955)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: A lot of steps. it’s not special this year. Every year, we take a lot of steps like, it depends upon launching of new NPDs we launch every year and then new markets, new distributors, opening new outlets, then e-commerce. The penetration in e-commerce earlier it was through a distributor now it is through BAS. A lot of steps, there are like 15-20 steps we take. The strategy we can't define right now. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tanmay Gupta 
Text: But the pricing would be around Rs. 400-Rs. 600? Means the mass segment we will be focusing on?

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Varun Gajaria 
Text: What is the impact of BIS that we'll be seeing on overall raw materials supply and the relevant demand across industries? Because it seems there has been some commentary in the market that currently some of the factories based out in China have not been approved. So sourcing of sportswear, especially has been a challenge since the first few months. How do you see that trending in terms of inventory and overall demand? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.986)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: As far as we are concerned, we have implemented these BIS standards. And it is the people who have been importing and depending on them, maybe they will face some problems. But as far as we are concerned, we have been our own manufacturers and selling. So we will have no issue of that.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: So the question was with the quality control being implemented now, has that led to any increase in the production cost per pair for us or any sort of something? Is there any meaningful uptake that we are seeing in that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Well, there have been some moderate increase in costs which we have already accordingly passed down and revise the rates. So not a major issue at all. Our quality is otherwise also good, we have been always quality-conscious players. So it was not much of a thing. Only certain specs which government wanted to have, so we have aligned these. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: Correct. So then in that scenario how do you rate the implementation across competition that are operating in the same price points? And how do you think the adherence is being like implementation? How would you rate the implementation actually going on that level? Are the competitors and everyone following that vigorously? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: As per the rule, government has exempted micro and small from this implementation of QCO. It is only on medium and large industry. We are one of the large industries. So as far we are concerned, we have implemented. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: But, means at the ground level are you seeing that means, because some players are exempted, is there any differential that has been created, is there any impact coming out of it on the overall demand? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: No, we do not see that. It's too early to say that because there's some extension given by government also. So it's, we'll wait and watch what the situation is there. a lot in open footwear also that the rural is picking up? And people are going back to normal. So how do you see the journey in that point of time and do you see that further a good amount of pickup happening there? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.577)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So in last year inflation was high, and we witnessed a lot of down trading by consumers. And because of that there were delay in purchases of sport shoes which is discretionary in nature. So going forward we are expecting good monsoon and the demand should definitely uptake. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: Okay. And you believe while as you rightly mentioned there was some market share loss, but we have gained by passing on the raw material price increase. Substantial room for further gaining share lift? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: This year we have taken a lot of sales transformation initiatives. That will help the company to grow at a better rate than competition I think.

Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

And going forward, what should be the opportunity from this kind of thing? This is my first question. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So premiumization is a journey. So every year, we are trying to increase our ASP. Last year, because of the demand the volume was more than the value. So this year also, we are expecting in our NPD we'll launch more of the premium articles and try to increase our ASP higher. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Shayantina Chaudhary 
Text: Yes. So despite that, our realization trend is going to be in the range of Rs. 145-Rs. 150 or there will be an increase in the same? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: Definitely, there will be an increase because we, last to last year we were at Rs. 161 which came down to Rs. 148. So we'll definitely try to go above what we did last year. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Shayantina Chaudhary 
Text: Okay. And sir, I just wanted to understand how much quantum of revenue comes from this premium portfolio in percentage? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Kumaar Dua 
Text: So if you talk like , we have a premium brand called Sparx which is contributing 1/3 rd of our total sales. So if you talk about premium definitely we have added more brands like Bahamas and Flite Urban Basics. So our journey is on, we have to improve in premium range. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Shayantina Chaudhary 
Text: So this will continue to remain one-third this year or we are looking some increase in that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.943)

Speaker: Shayantina Chaudhary 
Text: Okay. And so any percentage figures that how much e-commerce forms that are part of the total channel? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: There is no exception because revenue has not grown as expenses has grown. So in cases implied, definitely, there is an increment and adding of some people also. So because revenue has grown by hardly 5%, so that's why percentage has increased. But in absolute terms, there is a normal inflation cost has increased. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Resha Mehta

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: Volume, you said it was different, right? You said value it was same, but volume was different, right? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Yes, volume-wise definitely different. So let me get some data. Just as we can see it. If we can get it, just, I think I have to provide? Any anything else except this one?

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: Nothing. That was the only question.

Text: Next question is from the line of Mr. Onkar Ghugardare from Shree Investments. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: My question is are the management setting any internal targets for the next three-four years? So themselves in terms of revenue, profitability, cash flow, ROE, ROCE, etcetera, to grow the business? Just wanted to know the management’s vision in the business? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Next year, we have told. We will be having double-digit growth. We aim to grow it at double digit growth for the next two-three years. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: What about the other parameters? Profitability, ROE, ROCE? challenge in EBITDA or profitability. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Why this specific question, is that let's say 5-6 years back this was a different kind of Relaxo we used to see. But now that thing is no more in the company. If you look at the ROE it was at best industry best level. The revenue growth were also seemed very good. But I guess, last three-four years that has not been the case and this question? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. Because in the past, there was a lot of volatility in the raw material prices that affected us. Since we have to import the raw materials, we have to maintain a long supply chain, but now things are stable. That is why we are telling things will be a little better. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Raw material volatility affects each and every player in the industry, right? I mean why won't it affect only Relaxo? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Because we are one of the largest importer of raw material. We can't depend upon local availability of material. The local players they have smaller consumption. And they buy from a local market. But we have to maintain a long supply chain from all imports. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Correct. The raw material volatility would have been there five, six years back as well, right? Still your growth was quite good. I just wanted to know what is the exact reason for this? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: Actually this raw material volatility what you are talking about, it has been too much if we talk about previous year. Because we talk about EVA from Rs. 120 per kg, it went to Rs. 300. And this is short span, it came down to Rs. 150-Rs. 120 again. That kind of volatility we've never seen in the past. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. So this is like related to particular commodity you are talking about, volatility in particular commodity? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It was ethylene vinyl acetate polymer. It was low density polyethylene also, PVC also. All polymers, they became volatile. Because we have to keep, I mean, a good inventory of all these things. And that was the reason for that. Otherwise, generally, we are beneficial in the rising market. We always have good inventory. This is the first time when it rose to Rs. 300 and then came down Rs. 150. So that affected us. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. Can you confidently say that for the next couple of years, your profit will be higher than the revenue growth at least? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. Nobody can predict what kind of raw material you will get, what kind of extra uncontrolled circumstances we'll be facing. Only thing is we have to see, we have to keep ourselves competitive. And based on the raw material costs, we have to keep our pricing. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: In terms of growing the business, what kind of model you are targeting? Like EBO or like company? Like What kind of models you are targeting, the online model or like what exactly are you targeting? exports should grow. We're focusing on all these channels, not any channel at the cost of another channel.

We have already uploaded the earnings press release and investor presentation on the Stock Exchange as well as at our website and hope you have had the opportunity to go through those. Before we begin the question-and-answer session, let me give some highlights on Q2 and H1 FY24 Financial Performance of the Company, beginning with Q2: Revenue in Q2 FY24 was Rs. 715 crores, up 7% from Rs. 670 crores in Q2 FY23. We witnessed strong demand during the quarter which has led to a strong recovery in volumes driven by open footwear. EBITDA recorded a strong 54% Y-on-Y growth at Rs. 92 crores as against Rs. 59 crores in the corresponding quarter of last year. Softening of raw material prices and better operational efficiency due to economies of scale enabled us to enhance our EBITDA margin by 392 bps in this quarter. EBITDA margin was at 12.8% in Q2 FY24 as against 8.9% in Q2 FY23. PAT almost doubled in this quarter at Rs. 44 crores as against Rs. 22 crores in Q2 FY23. PAT margin stood at 6.2%, up 283 bps from 3.3% in Q2 FY23. In H1 FY24 we recorded a revenue of Rs. 1,454 crores vis-à-vis Rs. 1,337 crores in H1 FY23, an increase of 9% year-on-year basis. EBITDA was at Rs. 199 crores from Rs. 146 crores in same period of last year, up by 37%. EBITDA margin was at 13.7% as compared to 10.9% in H1 FY23, an expansion of 280 bps. PAT for H1 FY24 at Rs. 101 crores against Rs. 61 crores in H1 FY23, grew by 65%. PAT margin was at 6.9% as compared to 4.6% in H1 FY23. The company incurred a CAPEX of Rs. 56 crores as on 31st September ’23. We remain a net debt-free Company with positive cash from operations. We remain committed to provide quality product as per evolving customer needs with focus on premium and innovative products. We continue to expand our strong distribution network with a special emphasis on new channel and e-commerce. Thank you. Now we can open the floor for questions.

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Onkar Ghugardare from Shree Investments. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Sir, Good afternoon. I was asking about, till last year you were talking about premiumization of the entire product category. But since last year you have taken price corrections. So, exactly what kind of strategy you are looking at? Higher number of pairs to be sold and with less value or other way around. That’s the first question. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.534)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Last year we did some price correction. Before that we had lost some market share to competition. After price correction we have regained our market share. So, our volume growth has been more than 20%. As far as premiumization is concerned, focus is there in Sparx, in Bahamas and already we are having a good traction of these premium articles. So, that focus is there, and it will continue. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: But the loss of market share was due to higher prices of your products or was there any other reason for that? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Last year because of higher, we had a lot of old stock, costly inventory in the system. Because our industry operates on lot of import materials, we have to have a supply chain of around 6 months of that material. So, that is why it took some time to consume. Meanwhile market rate had fallen. But now our inventory in the system, now it is comfortable. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: The second question is on the revenue of the Company. So, what kind of revenue you are expecting in the second half? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are expecting a double-digit growth in the second half. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. Just a last question on ROE and ROCE which has been falling from last two three years. What’s your strategy on that front? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Strategy because margins are under pressure, so once things will settle so definitely ROE and ROI will better because then capacity utilization and more earning will be there. So, that percentage will improve with the performance. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Regarding that what kind of margins are sustainable? Now you have clarity on this? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: For the next half, 14%+ EBITDA. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: EBITDA 14%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: So, you are expecting this margin in the upcoming quarters or like because the current margin is less than the margin which you are projecting. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.98)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: You are right. But when the volume goes up our sale go up then H2 is going to better than H1, so things will improve. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Due to operating leverage you will gain the margin, right? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Automatically because of operating leverage our EBITDA will improve. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: So, what's the capacity utilization you are working at currently, at Q2 what was it and what do you expect to be? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Currently it is 63% utilization. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: That is for Q2 you are talking, right? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: H1 we are talking about; it is around 63%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. So, what kind of capacity utilization you see you will work with going forward? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It will remain around 65%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay, All right, Thank you!

Text: The next question is from the line of Aliasgar Shakir from Motilal Oswal. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Yeah, Thank you so much for the opportunity. I had a question on your closed footwear. So, we had a very good trade show I think a couple of months back where we had displayed the entire range of our closed sportswear. I just wanted to understand a couple of things. First is Q3 typically is your large quarter for sportswear. So, how is the initial response and what is the kind of demand and growth that we are seeing? Our composition of sportswear—I think correct me if I’m wrong—is somewhere about Rs. 250 and 300 crores. So, what kind of growth we expect? And our competitor has had a significant size and I think we’ve also had aspiration to grow significantly, so do you think this is a category which can be somewhere close to like a Rs. 1,000 crores contributor to you in probably a few years? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: You are right that this category has huge potential to grow and what you’re saying Rs. 1,000 crores, maybe in 2-3 years we will definitely plan to grow to that level. Regarding the market situation as you know the market is still not picked up what we were expecting. So, we have done lot of retail meets across India and distributor meets. The initial response because of this Pitrupaksha and untimely rains, market has still not given good feedback till now in terms of uptake in the market. So, it’s too early. Diwali is in November, so we are expecting November should be better. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: So, our base would be very low, so of course from that base we should see a very good performance even in Q3. And just a follow up over there is that one feedback on the ground is that the margins in the sportswear is not very compelling and therefore Relaxo sportswear is not very well received by the distributors and retailers. Have we made any changes over there? Do you think we have addressed the issues at the distributor level? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, we have made no changes since last 4-5 years. And regarding distributors they are always complaint about margin. That is their trade habit. They need more margins. So, we are having the fixed margin which we have not changed from last 5 years. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Even in the sportswear? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, it’s same. We have not changed. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Got it. Okay and in Q3 from the last year’s base do you think this quarter will considering the kind of market weaknesses there we should expect things to only recover after a couple of quarters. You think Q3 because of a low base we can expect strong growth from sportswear. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, we are keeping our fingers crossed and last 7 months has not been so encouraging. In terms of the uptake of this sports footwear. The market is still a little challenging. So, we are just hoping for the best that this should now pick up. It’s been 7 months like market is not responding. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.989)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Yash More from RV Investments. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Yash More 
Text: Good evening. My first question is regarding the market share. You said we have gained the lost market share. So, what’s the current market share? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: In volume if you talk about at a Company level, last year if you see we lost around 20%-25% in volume, drop was there in the open footwear which caused Hawaii and Flite, that only we have regained it back. So, there is a 27% in H1 growth in volume you can see that, what share we lost last year we have gained it back. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Yash More 
Text: I was asking about the UK FTA, what's our position and what are we doing regarding the FTA, what benefits do we see?

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Yash More 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: Not much. These European markets or the UK market had been more, in footwears sense, could be more for leather footwear. But we are more into non leather footwear. So, that's why it may not be…. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.993)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Not of any impact on us.

Text: Thank You. The next question is from the line of Abhishek Getam from Alpha Invesco. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Abhishek Getam 
Text: My question was regarding premiumization strategy. So, largely our open footwear are sub Rs. 200 ASP. What are our plans going ahead to bring whole portfolio level or footwear level to a higher ASP? I mean sort of the whole Company portfolio in the range of Rs. 500+ ASP and what strategy would we go for, Tier 1 or Tier 2, 3? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.781)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: If you remember we have taken the last price cut of rationalized price in September. So, since then, the prices were less. Now if you see October that ASP has increased and regarding the premiumization, we have brands like in Flite we have launched Urban Basics which is again Rs. 400+ MRP. We are working on the portfolio of Sparx which is more than Rs. 1000 to 1500 MRP. So, we are continuously working on our portfolio to increase the ASP and improve on premiumization. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Abhishek Getam 
Text: Understood. So, what part would be Rs. 500 plus ASP contributing to our revenue? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It's roughly around 10%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Abhishek Getam 
Text: Where do we see this to achieve involved in terms? Do we see this to improve this 50% sort of in a longer-term horizon (+5) year? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. Our 80% as on day business comes from open footwear. The Company is focused on serving masses. 20% is coming from our closed footwear. That is why average comes out low. But our focus is there of premiumization whether it is Bahamas, Flite or Sparx. So, maybe 20% of that will ultimately build up premium. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.717)

Speaker: Abhishek Getam 
Text: So, down the line like 4-5 years down the line we can expect it to 30%-35% sort of contributor? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to see what kind of traction we get from these categories. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.992)

Speaker: Abhishek Getam 
Text: Okay Sir, Thank You Sir.

Text: Thank You. The next question is from the line of Priyank Chheda from Vallum Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyank Chheda 
Text: There's an observation where your volumes have remained flat over the quarter since COVID at an average of 45-50 million pairs per quarter. This has been the trend for the sector also. It's not only pertaining to Relaxo as such. Can you help us understand why the volumes haven't picked at a consumer level? What are the key factors that's driving such a muted demand? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: There was an up and down since COVID, the first wave, second wave, third wave. So, things have not stabilized and then that price increase was there in 2022-23 because of war. So, it's been like the last 3-4 years the industry has been facing lot of turmoil. Now this year we were expecting that the industry will grow but last 6-7 months there's no sign of huge uptick in the markets because of again untimely rains, inflation pressure in rural India. So, that's why the industry is struggling to grow to that level. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.962)

Speaker: Priyank Chheda 
Text: If I have to again summarize the price increases that you saw in FY23 led to a poor demand in volumes and then again in FY24 the volume pickup hasn't been seen yet. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.942)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, you're right. That's why we have been able to get that volume back of 30% growth. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyank Chheda 
Text: Got it. There has been a BIS standard that has been implemented in the footwear. If you can help us, what would be the implication for us as well as for the industry? How do you see this shaping up for the industry as well? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It is going to become mandatory from January ‘24. So, whatever products we are making, specifications of that, government have number of times revised. Now we are working on that, making a specification and we are quite ready to follow these government regulations from January. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyank Chheda 
Text: Does this mean that a lot of China footwear imports will get reduced? If you can help us quantify how much would be China imports in footwear which would not fall under this BI standard? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.992)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, even whatever goods will be coming to our country everything has to be as per BIS standards. Nothing will come out of this standard. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyank Chheda 
Text: Got it. So, would this mean that a lot of unorganized players who would not be able to cater these standards would lose out market share and in turn beneficial for brands like you? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We think so. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyank Chheda 
Text: Okay. Just a bookkeeping question on our Sparx brand sales if you can help us, on annualized basis what would be the Sparx brand sales? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Between 35% to 40% share goes to Sparx brand. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyank Chheda 
Text: Within that what would be the closed and open, sandals and sports shoes break up roughly? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Overall 20% is our closed footwear and 80% is our open footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua

Speaker: Manan Madlani 
Text: Hi, Thanks for the opportunity Sir. My question is around our raw material side. What kind of scenario are you seeing? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: At the moment for the last few months, prices have stabilized by and large. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manan Madlani 
Text: Okay. So, going forward do we expect gradual gross margin improvement from here onwards? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Ultimately always we have to be watchful of the market conditions, competition, how it is and keep our prices competitive. We keep on watching this every quarter by quarter. When the volume grows automatically our margin also grows along with it. At the moment, for the past 6 months or so, the situation has been quite challenging, sentiments are low particularly from rural markets, mass segment. But with the volume growth our margin will definitely improve further. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manan Madlani 
Text: And we were doing some channel check and we realized that there is some price difference across majorly all categories between our EBOs and our website. So, what is the strategy behind that?

Text: No, we have one price only across all channels.

Given that the underlying demand in mass segment is currently subdued and given that the RM cost is on a declining or a stable trajectory, can we say that price action be it upwards or downwards is not behind and this price stability will come in the market or in next two quarters if the demand doesn't revive, we could take some price correction as well to gain market share? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.973)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We are not going to take any more price corrections because raw material prices has been stabilized and we don't see that there is an increase in any raw material price. So, our focus is on distribution expansion. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: And on distribution expansion we are going for direct reach now. So, if you can just give some color today where we are and in 1 year-2 years what is the target what we are looking at? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: In India we have lot of white spaces across the country. So, we are going to have a secondary focus, secondary driven sales approach rather than a primary push. So, there is a whole strategy working behind it how to increase our footprints across India. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Can you elaborate on this strategy? It will help us understand the business better. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.95)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, like we have discussed earlier also that there are 1 lakh MBO outlets in India. So, currently we are at 65,000 outlets. So, every year we are going to add more and more outlets to grow. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.888)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: My second question is regarding EVA and PU; are you seeing both these products seeing some pressure or EVA is doing better than PU and PU is where there is some impact of demand? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: No, we are seeing both are growing equally and I think both have good future. So, it's not like one is growing one is not growing. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: My last question is colored Hawaii versus non-color Hawaii. In colored Hawaii we have seen more competition from Aqualite, Walkaroo and others while in non-colored you're pretty much the market leader. Anything we are doing on colored Hawaii to gain market share? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: As you know we have a brand called Bahamas which is in colored Hawaii. We are growing well in that category. Last year there was a struggle because of huge MRP. Now it has been cleared, our old stock has been cleared and we are able to get the market share back. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: What will be our Bahamas contribution? If you can give us growth between the brands it would be helpful. Between what was the Sparx growth for the quarter or half year versus Bahamas and Flite. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, if I talk about volume, in Hawaii and Bahamas both its upward of 20%, the volume growth we have done. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: So, even the Company volume growth is pretty much in the same trajectory. So, where is the pressure coming from? Because at the Company level we have done 23% volume growth odd. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Pressure is coming from it's more of like Sparx brand, the closed footwear because season has just started. The last 6 months it was more of open footwear. Now the season has started for closed footwear. So, let us see how this quarter and next quarter goes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: With the new capacity coming in now on stream and with the new product the response being good, where do you think what changes assuming the market stays where they are, what is in your hands to drive demand in the market from closed footwear perspective? Is it the competitive intensity very strong, will you add, do more promotional activities on the ground, spend more on brand ambassador to gain market share? Because assuming the market stays the way it is for next 6 months to 9 months. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, whatever you have said all activities we are in the process of doing, be it spend on BTL- ATL, launching more articles, doing NPD meets, distributor meet, retailer meets so everything is like because this is Q3 is a season for closed footwear. So, all activities are aligned to get the growth in this quarter and next. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: But for winter is just around the corner, so your primary push would have happened in the month of October. So, if you can just share how has been the October month’s progress for closed footwear it will just help us understand how the underlying growth is coming for the season. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.873)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We have mentioned before that there are a lot of competitions, unorganized and organized have entered in this category. So, we are seeing like lot of discounts are being offered by unorganized and other players who have entered in the market. So, it's not going to be too easy to win this market. So, let us see how these 2-3 months goes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.525)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Understood, Thank you so much sir.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh 
Text: Hello Sir. I see that there has been some change in the top management and Mr. Shravan Kumar Singh has ceased to be the KMP of the Company. So, just wanted to ask does he will continue to be an employee at Relaxo? What really happened? And have you identified a replacement for him? Sushil Batra : He has come, he's not KMP. He is in senior management list. So, he has joined as a New Product Development Head. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Harsh 
Text: Someone else has joined also as the head of product development? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Shravan Kumar Singh is with us; he has joined as a New Product Development head. He's part of senior management. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Jain 
Text: This is Ankit Jain; Company Secretary. I just want to update that due to some internal change in roles and responsibilities Mr. Shravan Kumar Singh has stepped down under the senior management category, but he will be continuing as NPD Head of the Company. This is the internal decision of the management, but he's continuing as VP NPD. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Harsh 
Text: So, the role of VP NPD has been shifted from being a senior management role? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ankit Jain 
Text: Yes, he's not here on the Senior Management list but he's part of Company only. He's the head of the NPD. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh 
Text: Okay, Got it. After taking the price cuts last year, we have seen that we have gained market share especially in the Flite and Bahamas category. Do you reckon this market share gain story will continue in the ensuing quarter as well? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, definitely it will continue, and we'll gain market share. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh 
Text: To that extent the volume growth will keep on coming in the next quarter as well in spite of the industry being a bit tepid right now. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Like I have mentioned before also, last price cut rationalization was in September. So, this kind of volume will not be there. Now value growth will be there. So, volume growth is 27% is I don't think so in next few quarters, maybe 15%, not that much higher because the gap was in first 6 months. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Harsh 
Text: Okay, Got it. Thank you. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Akhil Parekh from Centrum Broking. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Thanks for the opportunity. My first question is what the possible reasons for the demand weakness could be, now given that we have already taken price corrections and it's almost two quarters now. So, if you can highlight broader reasons probably why the demand continues to be weak? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, consumer sentiment has been sluggish in the mass segment and that we are witnessing across the country and whole footwear category we are seeing that the sentiments are not that great. So, that's why if the industry does not grow then there will be little challenge. We are seeing this because of monsoon, inflation. That rural market is definitely not responding. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: That I understand that the sluggishness is there in mass segment but unfortunately none of the companies have been able to clarify what are the clear reasons, why we are seeing this pressure given that the inflation has already started to decrease. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, but the demand at rural markets should also be there. We are seeing that walk ins of consumers are not that which was before. So, maybe the discretionary spent at rural level is not there. We can assume that. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Has that started to improve now given the festival already started? Do we see that improvement now in month of October? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It's too early to comment upon it. We are waiting for this season. This may improve or maybe November-December things may improve. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Second is if you could just update on the DMS 2.0 implementation which we have been talking about since last few quarters. Have we seen any, how far we have reached in terms of implementation and are we seeing any positive impact? Because one common feedback we were getting is the wholesaler were undercutting on pricing basically. If you can just highlight something on DMS. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, DMS 2.0 now 50% of our distributor we have implemented this 2.0 and our plan is in next 3 months we'll make it 100%. Regarding price cut, price cut by distributor we have not seen that. But maybe it's not in the DMS that they can cut the price. DMS is just to get the inventory and how we can do secondary with them and align our schemes accordingly. DMS is not implemented to control the distributor discount to the retailer. It is mainly to drive the secondary and have the control how things are going.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: I just wanted to know, what are the export percentages of the revenue currently and what kind of scope do you think you have and the margin profile over there? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: This quarter also H1 if you say, around we have around 4% contribution and we expect to have this kind of percentage maintenance in future as well. Maybe a little bit we can have more because the growth is little better compared to other channels so we will be able to get little better percentage as a contribution. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: I just wanted to know what is the margin profile over there as compared to the domestic market? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: It is in line of same like what domestic we are earning, in the same lines, earning margins in exports has been. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: So, they are same, right? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Maybe given the capacity utilization at 63%-64%, isn't it possible to push exports little bit given the push of the government to the sector as well? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.984)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: We have been doing that because whenever we have started the export we have been doing in our own brand, so wherever we are putting our products in whichever markets, and we are getting good traction, and we are able to get sustained growth in consumer pool as well. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: And what's the percentage of online sales currently? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, we are doing roughly around 12%, the contribution of online and new channel. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: And how it has gone up or gone down since COVID. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, if you compare with the last year, it is same as what I was talking earlier also, that industry is not doing, they are also feeling the pressure, so the growth rate is same. It's not that we are able to grow more. So, however, we are adopting a cautious approach also in this e-commerce because it's a very important channel for us to drive future growth. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.801)

Text: Sir, Thanks for taking question. What has been the growth in Sparx brand in the first half of FY24? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Sparx brand has not grown. It is just because our competition intensity was there, some of the segments like SFG category has grown. Now, festival season starting got delayed also. Now November onward we are optimistic that this will grow. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jaspreet Walia 
Text: First half sales are broadly flat zero growth YOY. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Nominal, maybe 3%-4%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jaspreet Walia 
Text: Ok got it Sir and what are the plans to increase the number of EBOS in the second half of FY24?

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are having a little cautious approach. The things we are doing to improve the planogram, improve the consumer friendliness, training the staff and also trying to find out how to improve the efficiency of our retail outlets. And then we have a plan for expanding the network, the retail outlets.

Speaker: Archana Gude 
Text: Hi Sir, just one question from my side. What is the revenue on the geographic basis and what are the efforts you are putting in to increase our market share in south? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.922)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, if you see we are doing 45% coming from north zone, followed by east zone of 22%, then west 20% and 15% is south. Regarding south market, there is a challenge of growth because the demand is subdued specifically in south market. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Archana Gude 
Text: So, that would be for both the categories open and close? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua

Text: Thank You. The next question is on the line of Sachee Trivedi from Trident Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: Thank you for taking my question. The question I have is that in a previous earnings call, you had indicated that Sparx revenue will go from Rs. 400 crores to around Rs. 1,000 crores over the next 2-3 years which I think was around FY26. Is that still something in your plan and if yes then how do you plan to execute towards this goal? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.926)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Though this year has been a little challenging. But our focus on premiumization is particularly in Sparx category and particularly on shoes and this year there are a lot of premium articles in Sparx, and we are getting a good traction. Based on our experience we are focusing on this and likely to grow but not this year. It is a year of stabilization and improvement and learning and accordingly then we'll open retail outlets also, we will utilize e-commerce also, the things will go accordingly. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: Your other expenses have gone up 24% year-on-year. I'm assuming this is sales and marketing and promotion. Is this to help the Sparx brand or is this for everything, all the product categories? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: All brands are being advertised. Marketing expense spends are in all brands. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: Okay, Now in terms of your distribution channels you have the MBO, you have the EBO, and you have the online channel. Do you think you should be looking at a differential pricing across these three channels given that the customer that comes to your e-commerce channel is very different from a customer that comes to your MBO channel? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, if you see instead of having different pricing, we have different brand offerings. So, Sparx is more relevant for EBOs and online because it's more than Rs. 1000 MRP. And for the mass market or MBO outlets which are 1 lakh outlet across India, for them we have Hawaii and we have Flite and Bahamas brand. So, we have segmented brand according to the price rather than giving different discounts. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: And then one question on your MBO market particularly in the rural segment, should we think of it as a consumer discretionary spend or is it actually an important spend because if somebody's chappal is broken then they need to replace it? And then the question is why are they not buying a Relaxo brand to replace the chappal and going for something else? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: What we have seen is that because of inflation their visits have been little reduced. So, that's why what we are seeing is that the payments are not coming from the distributor and from the retailers. So, because of inflation and their discretionary spend going down, they are little selective in buying. That is the trend from last 6 months. But we are hoping that this will improve because of festive season coming and stabilization of prices are there. Raw material has been stabilized, so there should be an uptake in the demand. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: But that is assuming that this is a consumer discretionary spend and I'm wondering if in the rural market this is actually a consumer staple item. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: If you have seen we have grown in volume, so we have definitely gained the market share there also. But that Sparx is the category where we are seeing that the spends have because it's more of discretionary where the buying has been low. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: Sparx is discretionary but your Relaxo brand Bahamas and Flite particularly where you are selling to the rural and many times in the call, you have mentioned that is where you are seeing a slowdown, and you are hoping the festival season will see an uptick. And I'm challenging that part and asking if actually a Relaxo chappal is a consumer staple item for that market. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.686)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: No, we agree with that. But overall market should also have been growing. We are growing in that space. But industry also has to grow. There should be huge demand from the consumer side, so all categories will grow. We are not facing any challenge in open footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: How are you tracking the progress of the various initiatives that you have put in place right now to get back some of that revenue growth, what metric do you follow very closely? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.87)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Through DMS we are able to know how many retail outlets are being served, so month after month we see category wise region wise. So, that is the parameter we see. The more retailer our distributor is able to serve, so that means our reach is increasing. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We keep on monitoring the reach of our SOs also direct reach we talk about that. They are visiting 60,000 outlets, so that has been monitored every month, how productive the calls are, what are the orders they are taking, how they help by secondary, how we are fulfilling the demand. It's a monthly process.

Text: Thank you, Prerna. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on this earnings call for the quarter and fiscal year ended 31st March 2023. The earning press release and the investor presentation have been uploaded on the stock exchange as well as at our website, and we hope you have had the chance to go through these. Before we begin the question and answer, I will quickly go through the Q4 and FY '23 performance starting with Q4. In Q4 FY '23, we recorded revenue of INR 765 crores as against INR 698 crores in Q4 FY '22, recording a growth of 10% year-on-year. On a Q-on-Q basis, the revenue increased by 12%. This is mainly due to volume growth across all categories. Our Q4 FY '23 EBITDA was at INR 118 crores, up by 6% year-on-year, from INR 111 crores in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. EBITDA margins were at 15.4% in Q4 FY '23 as against 15.9% in the corresponding quarter. On a Q-on-Q basis, EBITDA margins have grown substantially by 481 basis points due to the selling of low cost inventory along with costly old inventory. PAT at INR63 crores, on a sequential basis, that grew by 110% from INR30 crores in Q3 FY '23. PAT margin for Q4 FY '23 was 8.3%. Our price correction efforts during the last quarter have resulted in good momentum, and we have continued our market share recovery in all major segments during this quarter without relying much on discounts and offers. Now moving on to full year FY '23. Despite the challenging environment last year, our strong team responded effectively and our commitment to maintaining our high standard of excellence have made us successful. Revenue for FY '23 was at INR 2,783 crores, up by 5% year-on-year from INR 2,653 crores in FY '22. EBITDA was at INR 336 crores as against INR 416 crores in FY '22. EBITDA margin was at 12.1% as against 15.7% in FY '22. Margins were affected We are now a debt-free company with robust cash flow from operation due to our strong working capital management. During the year, the company incurred a capex of INR 174 crores. With the stabilization of raw fuel prices in Q4, we are currently experiencing strong demand and hold an optimistic view of the future. Our company is strategically positioned to take advantage of the opportunities within the industry, allowing us to further expand our market share. Our key strengths lie in our in-house manufacturing capabilities, the quality of our product, and the strong recall of our brand. We remain dedicated to upholding these strengths and will persistently strive to maintain their integrity. We are confident that our continued efforts will lead positive outcome for us in the time ahead. Thank you. Now we can open the floor for questions.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Congratulations to finally seeing a good market share trend in your company. I have 3 questions. First is on the current quarter. So I understand from our channel checks that post cleanup of the old inventory, market demand has picked up quite strongly. And in fact, Relaxo has not been able to meet all the distributor demand. So is this true in multiple geographies? And do you think we would have lost any revenue because of that factor, if you could just quantify what could have been the impact of that in this quarter? And has that been now subsided? Or we are still seeing demand not being able to fully be met? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: What you said is partly correct, that there is an upsurge in demand, and we are seeing it. One reason is that we have corrected the prices. And second, this is a peak season for us for open footwear. As we are 75% open and 25% closed, so this is the open footwear starting from January to June to July. And regarding the shortages, we are managing. We have inventory with us and the uptake we are seeing across India for the open footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Got it. So can you quantify if we would have lost any revenue because of that in this quarter? And has that been now subsided? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It happened in February because there were some IT issues, which have been corrected. And now we are able to cover. We have sufficient inventory. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Okay. Got it. Second question is on your margins. So while we have significantly reduced prices, we have seen impact on margins. So can you share, I mean, what is the trend we should expect in the coming quarters as raw material prices are also softening? Should we see that helping us and therefore the impact on margin that we saw in this quarter should improve? How should we see that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Market remains challenging, and we have to be very cautious with respect to our pricing of our articles so that we always have a good market share as far as sales are concerned. The EBITDA margin that you have seen in this quarter is likely to continue, and there is likely to be some improvement also. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Some improvement, yes. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Understood. And just last question on the closed footwear in the sportswear category. I understand that we have made a lot of changes in our design team, online team. If you could share some thoughts in terms of what is the strategy in the sportswear in terms of new product development and what is the aim in the next 3 - 4 years. Can we expect to reach about INR 1,000 crores in 3 - 4 years' time? I mean, if you can just share what is your strategy there. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So if you talk about Sparx sports shoes, we have seen healthy growth. We have done roughly around 25% growth. And before that, last year, we put up a plant to cater to this need. So still, the plant capacity still we have. It will take 2 - 3 years to reach to that level, and you're talking about INR1,000 crores, Sparx is already INR1,000-plus crores brand. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Yes. But sports wear would be relatively lower? Or I mean, of course, Sparx is much bigger, but within that sportswear, if you could just quantify how much would that be? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.883)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So that is roughly around -- we do sports shoes and all sports category, roughly around INR 400 crores. So definitely, we have aspirations to become INR1,000 crores. And it will take 2 years, 3 years, time will tell. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Text: Next question comes from the line of Vikas Jain from Equirus. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: For the first question, definitely, we have seen a market share which you have regained from which we were lost to our earlier competitors. So at this point of time, can you really say that you have regained almost all of the market share or some part of it is still left? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Can you repeat the question? It's not so clear. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: I was mentioning about the market share. So have you like reached -- regained the entire market share and reached to what we were at the pre-COVID times? Or probably some part of it is still more or less left to gain? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, definitely, what we have lost market share in last quarter 1 or quarter 2 last year, we are seeing the good momentum now, and we are gaining the market share back. So definitely, we will recover -- we have recovered. Now we'll recover more. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: Sir, second question with respect to the demand. Well, Ramesh sir did mention that the demand environment continues to remain challenging. So probably, is it like the -- how would you -- some comments with respect to how the underlying market is growing, and what do you think it will take for the market to normalize in what time period according to your estimates? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.529)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So actually, what we are hearing from the market that this Eid and this festive, there is a demand contraction happening in some parts of India. Rural India is still not able to cover up what it was contributing. But I think this is a temporary phenomenon. The inflation is now getting controlled, and we'll definitely see the uptake in coming quarters. contribution from the all 4 North, West, East and South? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So North contribute maximum to around 44%; followed by East, 22%; 20% is West and 15% is South. And we are maintaining this from last year, it is similar. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: Sure. And with respect to more distributors adding in the South, is that on time? Or how many have you added this year probably? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So it's not a great achievement in adding more distributors. We have maintained what we were having. So always, there will be a churn, new addition and some people leaving. So it's roughly around same. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Text: Next question comes from the line of Kaustubh Pawaskar from Sharekhan By BNP Paribas. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: So my question is on the price cut what we have taken to. So we have taken the price cut to reduce the pricing gap between the lower -- products which are around less than your price point products. But since you said that raw materials pricing had all corrected, have we seen any price reduction undertaken by those bottom of the pyramid players or lower price point players in the market? And because of which, again, the pricing difference what you were planning to reduce, it has again gone up. Any sense on that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. Now our prices are very competitive and there is no room for further price cuts. And even on competition, while we are very competitive, there's no issue. I don't think that there's any room -- competitor can do much about it. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.915)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: Okay. So you don't see any further price that's happening in the market, right? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, no. Not so. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: Okay, okay. And sir, my second question, you have been consistently talking about expanding your capacity. So any guidance for capex going ahead and where you're planning to add capacity? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.698)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: So last year, whatever capacity we wanted to expand, that has been expanded. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: Okay. So there is not going to be... 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: This year only, money is going on moulds, which are regular kind of things, some repair, moulds and backward integration, some capital asset generation, that's it. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: Okay. Any thoughts on your retail expansion front? By FY '23, how much was your reach and where you want to take it over the next 2 years?

Text: Next question comes from the line of Onkar Ghugardare from Shree Investments. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: My question was regarding -- it's from your investor presentation. So from FY '21 to FY '23, the average realization has gone up, but the number of pairs sold has decreased. So -- and in this quarter, the average realization has gone down significantly. But the number of pairs sold has been -- has increased dramatically. So like what's the management's view on this going forward? What would be the average cost of pairs or like how it is supposed to be in the future? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.522)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Last year, we had done major correction in some of our categories like Hawaii, EVA. So that was the reason that the average selling price has gone down. And our volume has gone up. So that is why volume is going up because the average rate has gone down, only because of reduction in prices. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.899)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: So from here on, what we can expect, a stabilization here? Or like... 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Stabilization, by and large stabilization. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.926)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. You don't see any upside from here on? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.992)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: On the whole year side because in this quarter, mostly open footwear was in demand. Closed footwear counts in winter season. So overall in the year, again, you will see our last year average price of INR 160 will be back. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.967)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. So for the current financial year, you are expecting around INR160 per pair realization? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Could be a little higher, also depending upon the shoes. If they're a little better, then things will be further. But around INR160, INR165, we can expect average. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. And what about the number of pairs? I mean, what could be the ballpark estimate for that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Definitely further. From the Last year, we expect double-digit growth in volume for this year. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. So around double-digit volume growth and around similar kind of average realization per pair or somewhat higher? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. As far as the ROE and ROC is concerned, what's your plan on next 2 - 3 years since it has come down dramatically, again, from FY '21 to FY '23? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Definitely, it will improve in coming years because last year was a tough year, profits were under pressure, and we did capex also. Next year, definitely, it will be much better than this FY '23. We can compare with FY '22, it was well. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Because it has now come down to a single digit now. That's what -- that's why I'm asking. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. As far as the demand outlook is concerned, how are you seeing currently this shaping up? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So currently, there is a little challenge in the market. There is a little demand contraction. But I think going forward, quarter 2, quarter 3 onwards, we will be better. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. In the current quarter, you are facing some demand issues? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.971)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes. Because what we hearing from the market that's still rural is not back on track. It's going to take a little time. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.923)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. Any update on what could be the export percentage? And how -- is there any opportunity for Relaxo? Or like the home market is so large that everyone bothered to think about -- or bothered to think about the export market? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: Exports we have done around 4%, 4.5% of total revenue. And the way we are growing the last 2 - 3 years' time, we're giving -- getting double-digit growth. And we are -- in the future also, we are expecting the same. Growth will sustain. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. The margins or they are better than the home market or like how it is? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: It is like similar. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Onkar Ghugardare 
Text: Okay. And which are the major countries you are exporting to? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: We're exporting to all these like regions we are growing, like Gulf, Oceania region or even Africa. Even Central America is now showing back on track because during COVID time, that was badly affected. But that also is going up. So all markets are good.

Text: Next question comes from the line of Ankit Kedia from PhillipCapital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: 11% realization drop Y-o-Y and quarter-on-quarter. How much is due to price cut and how much is due to mix change on new -- you introduced INR105 chappals also in the market last quarter. So can you give us that impact of mix process price cut? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The lowest-priced article that you're talking, that is very minimal. It has no -- any significance. It is just entry barrier kind of an article. But otherwise, whatever price cuts we could do on account of fall in our raw material prices that we have done, and that's it. No more price cut. They're competitive and optimistic. Since they're growing, we are getting our market share back. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: And sir, in this 11% realization drop, can you quantify how much is due to mix and how much is due to price cut? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.971)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Very complicated. We have 400 articles -- different articles, different pricing, different material consumption. So this is very difficult to quantify. I think article wise, everything are different. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. Because more polymers are required in open footwear, like the EVA or Hawaii slippers. But in sports shoe, upper is a different material, bottom is different material. So you're right. In case of sports shoes, price cut was not in there. It was almost same. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Understood. So the reading is the 75% open footwear, we would have taken a double-digit price cut, while in closed footwear, which is around 25% - 30% of our business, we would have not tinkered with the prices much. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, not much. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Understood. Sir, my second question is regarding promotions. We have seen higher promotional activity in the quarter in the market. Your competitors also in the month of January, February, March were very active by giving higher dealer commissions and even retailer commissions. So could you please elaborate, how was our promotion activity in the quarter? And going forward, how are you looking at your A&SP spend? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: If we maintain the A&SP spend -- in terms of schemes, we always -- we have -- like depends categories-to-category. Hawaii we have different types of schemes. And in shoe division, the reason we have different type of schemes. So seeing the demand, seeing the market scenario, seeing the pricing, we decide what kind of scheme we have to run. And we will see that in the competition also. So we don't benchmark exactly. We see what is our need and then we float the scheme. So we do not exceed -- the competition is giving more, let's give more. We have to analyze other situations also. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Sure. And what is the A&P target for next year? And how much is it for this year, if you can quantify? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So like if you talk about A&SP, we do around 8% to 9%, and we are maintaining this from last two, three years, and we will try to maintain a similar pattern in this coming year also. So this includes advertisement and promotion. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: And how much would be pure advertising? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Roughly around 4.5%, 4%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Understood, sir. And sir, if you can just share one of your competitors in sports shoes is going very aggressive in EBOs. While if I look at your EBO count for last four years, has been pretty much flat at 390-odd EBOs. Why haven't you expanded EBOs in last four years? What is the risk you see in EBO expansion, which has -- while COVID years were also there in two years, but still, the expansion has not been compared to the market where we are seeing competitors expand EBOs. So if you can just talk a bit on that? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. You're right that the last two years, we didn't expand. We wanted to make it a little more efficient because we have to control our bottom line also and our articles, 75% are open our products. Share of our retail outlet in the total scheme of things is around 8%. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Right. And is it fair to assume the margins in EBOs would be just near double digit and lower than the company average? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Yes. It's lower than company average, but I think the high single-digit margin, we are in that category. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Can you repeat again, can't hear you? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: Primary and secondary numbers? Because you are saying that Q1 is still soft, But your volume numbers, when I look at 5.2 versus 4.2 of last year or 4.1 of this quarter -- last quarter, they seem to be doing decent . So I'm just trying to understand what am I missing? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: I think, it's volume growth. Are you referring the number which you have mentioned in investor presentation. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: Yes. Volume growth. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: We sold more open footwear in this quarter and lot of demand was there. So that's why these numbers are very high as compared to earlier quarters. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: Okay. But wouldn't that be the case in the base quarter also? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: This current quarter, Q1, you're talking about? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: No. I'm just saying when I compare Q4 FY '22, where you sold 4.2 crores pairs versus 5.2 crores pairs in this quarter, the mix would be similar, right, this point which... 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. Also, I think it will be sustained. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Mix is also similar. You're right, yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: So this growth, is it -- the channel was running low on Relaxo products given our pricing and now it has stabilized? Is that a function of that? Or is it a lot of customer uptake also happening? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: No. It is like what we lost market share in Q1, Q2, Q3. Now we are regaining that market share. So we're getting the space back at helves. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Now, we are very competitive. That is why we are able to get the commissions. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: Okay. And just one last one, if you could give, let's say, for FY '23 as a whole, just a broad brand-wise split between Sparx, Flite PU, Flite EVA and Relaxo? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Sparx is around 40%; Flite is around 38% and rest is our Bahamas and Relaxo brand. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: So Sparx 40%, Flite is 28% and the rest is... 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Flite is 38%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: Okay. And how much would be Flite PU and EVA in that 38%? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: So you were asking in split of EVA and PU, EVA was 15% and PU was 23%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Of the 38%, the breakup we are telling. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Text: Total closed has been around 25%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: 45% sir? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: I think the query is within Sparx you're asking? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: Yes, within Sparx. So let's say, this INR2,800 crores you are saying, Sparx is roughly 40% of sales, roughly INR1,120 crores. How much is closed in that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: 40% is closed and 60% is open in INR1,000 crores. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: So it's roughly INR400 crores now. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurang Kakkad 
Text: Yes, hi, sir. Congrats on a good recovery in volumes as well as margins. I have two questions. Firstly, can you give the trend in terms of how the EVA prices are currently panning out? And what was the Q4 average pricing of EVA for you? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Now EVA prices are stabilized. It's around INR170, that is what -- this is at what rate we consume, although market maybe at INR160 only. This -- the current -- the month of -- current 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.772)

Speaker: Gaurang Kakkad 
Text: Okay. And last quarter, in the base, this would be very high, right, closer to INR250, INR300, Q4 FY '22? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.897)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It was INR250, quarter 1 -- for quarter 1 of this year -- of the past year in FY'22- '23. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurang Kakkad 
Text: Right. And currently, the prices are stable at around INR155, INR160, which is what the Q4 pricing -- average pricing was. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.949)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Correct. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurang Kakkad 
Text: Okay. And secondly, on the EBO outlet strategy, so you have been at those 400 outlets for some time now. And it's heartening to see that there is some plans in terms of expanding that by around like 15% this year. Now is it that we've got the model right in terms of EBO and now we can target healthy margins in the business? Or is it more so given that EBOs are largely Sparx brand focused. So we want to target aggressively and go aggressively on the Sparx brand. So what's the strategy out here? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Naturally, once we are having more efficiency in our stores, so we have started expanding this year, and we will continue the momentum the way things are. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurang Kakkad 
Text: Okay. So like every year, you will have around 60 stores, 70 store expansion in the EBO going ahead? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We hope so. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Gaurang Kakkad 
Text: Okay. And this high single-digit margin largely is sustainable or we can target to aim more closer to double-digit or even a bit higher once it's like fully scaled up and maybe two years, three years down the line? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, naturally. Down the line, things will improve further. But we have to be always cautious keeping in view competition, having a competitive pricing. But things will improve because once the sales improve, then efficiencies improve, overheads start getting low. So ultimately, your bottom line improves. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Now last year, you had said in FY '22 fourth quarter call that Sparx has 37.5% of overall sales, which makes the sales of Sparx INR 1,000 crores in FY '22. And this year, in the opening comment, you said it has grown 25%. So Sparx brand sales should be INR1,250 crores this year. And in your -- in one of the conversations you had with one of the people who asked questions, you said Sparx 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra

Speaker: Jasdeep Walia 
Text: Okay. And so what has been the overall growth in Sparx brand in FY '23? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Overall growth is around 10% to 12%. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua

Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.913)

Speaker: Jasdeep Walia 
Text: Got it. And sir, I'm assuming fourth quarter is an off-season for Sparx, right? So most of your sales in fourth quarter would be just open footwear sales, right? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Correct. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jasdeep Walia

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Correct. Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jasdeep Walia 
Text: Got it, sir. Got it. And sir, I have a query on your EBOs. So you mentioned that competitors opened more EBOs because they open EBOs only for their shoe brand. So why don't you do the same? Why don't you open only Sparx EBOs? So then you would have the same economics of your competition, right? Then the economics would be good. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Thanks for suggestion. We'll consider it. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jasdeep Walia 
Text: Got it. And in the current 400 EBOs, there are no Sparx branded EBOs, right, only Sparx branded EBOs? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. So far, no. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jasdeep Walia 
Text: Got it. Sir, my last question, sir, what is the composition of your exports? Is it only open footwear, or is it Sparx band? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: No. Actually, it is more of open footwear. I would say, around 60% of our international business comes from Hawaii, open footwear. As you say, basic like Bahamas and basic Relaxo brands put together.

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jogani from Axis Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: So my first question is with regards to the multiple price cuts over the last two, three quarters that we have seen. So has it led to some kind of multiple price points at the distributor end? And could this possibly lead to a change in the down stocking or some kind of inventory level change at the distributor level? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.959)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: You're correct. Like we have done multiple rounds of price cuts. So they had different types of MRPs, distributors and retailers. But now all of them have been cleared. It took three to six months to clear all the old MRP products. Now currently, as for demand, and we have the current prices available in the market, and there's no problem of stocking with the distributors. Currently, they are running short because of the season. This is the peak season. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.984)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Okay. And sir, yes, that was my follow-up question actually. Because of this clearance of the old prices that you have taken in the channel over the past three to six months, so could there be a case wherein because of this activity that you have taken in the past, the base for FY '24 becomes weaker and because of which we could see a higher volume growth for FY '24 because of that? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, yes, you will definitely see that. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Okay. So would it be prudent to expect at least 15% to 20% kind of a volume growth for FY '24 in that case? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We're targeting that currently. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Yes. We're looking to... 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: On double-digit growth in volume. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Okay, sure. And sir, my next question is with regards to, again, on the pricing part, while we see prior to the increase in the GST from 5% to 12% in products below INR1,000. And even if you compare it versus the pre-GST era, I think the taxation on this segment is now higher. So how does it -- how is it impacting demand at the lower end? And do you see, do you think there will be a permanent shift from some of these lower-end footwear to maybe some price -- high-priced footwear that you see in the future? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It's been one year since that tax has gone up from 5% to 12% and market has adjusted to the new price structure of 12%. And now I think market is comfortable with the new pricing structure in the GST structure. And we do not see any new player entering because of this or unorganised getting higher. We have taken the correction in prices and we have regained our shelf space. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Things are fairly stabilized now. segment versus -- in terms of the open footwear. So what kind of strategy the company is doing apart from these Sparx brand that it is running? Is there another sub-brand that the company is trying to experiment to introduce more designs or it will be only basically done through the Sparx brand itself? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.863)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, no. Currently, no more brand. We are focusing on these brands and accordingly, our price segmentation has taken place. So there's no plan of, I think, any new branded category. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Okay. And sir, in terms of the margin structure, if you see there is a lot of volatility in the margins over the last 3 years if you see, because on peak level, on an average, we have gone to 20% kind of EBITDA margins. And even in the bottom, we have touched 10% kind of EBITDA margins. So as per you, what kind of margins are sustainable in the business model that you operate, which is at a distributor like model? So what kind of margins should have one built at a steady- state case for a business like Relaxo? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.871)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Currently, we are, I think, aiming 15 %, 16% margin, so that thing gets fairly stabilized. We remain competitive. And then better efficiency may add further. Let us wait-and-see how the things pan out. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Sir, my question was more not on the near term, but more broader and a long-term question. Is this a business wherein we can target EBITDA margins also near 20%? And the reason I'm asking this question is because ours is a business where we're largely focus on price where the customer is more price conscious. So if we try to take the margins a bit higher, is there a case where you can attract more competition at that price points? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Definitely we have to be very cautious on this count. We should not just in an ambition to raise EBITDA and then we start losing market share. So -- but we have to always watch all the conditions, how is the market scenario, how is our efficiency level, then we have to improve our back-end efficiencies and become more competitive. At the same time, EBITDA can also improve in that case. So always you have to be agile and watchful of all those conditions to improve the things.Gaurav Jogani: So if I summarize or understand it better, I think you would like to keep your margin in a tight range wherein you remain competitive versus the competitors, but at the same time, also drive profitability for the business.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: My question is actually, I would say, my first point is almost a complaint, if you will. We are almost a $2.5 billion to $3 billion market cap company. But our engagement with the investors is extremely limited. And we do an earnings call every other quarter, and any attempt to get in touch with the management is basically we don't even get a response. Could we improve this, please? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.825)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. We can consider this. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Yes, you will get the response. We have IR agency also. You can connect them or you can connect our company secretary. So definitely, they will respond. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: Okay. Fine. I'll try again. My second question is, a few years ago, I had heard that you are the contract manufacturer for Nike shoes in India. Is that still true? And could you talk about that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: That was long back. It was more than 40 years back when we were doing the contract manufacturing for them. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sachee Trivedi 
Text: Okay. Okay. Fine. And then my final question is in terms of price margin and -- I mean, we are told that you can either fix the price or fix the margin. Which one of those do you fix? Or do you fix both and then work on the cost? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: So we have to be mindful of both the things. We have to fix our margin also and we have to aim for our market penetration and turnover also. Both the things, we have to balance out. We can't just look at one thing. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Text: Next question comes from the line of Akhil Parekh from Centrum Broking. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Just continuing on the previous participant's question. Sir, how should we look at Relaxo, right? I mean, pricing has been an issue for us in the past as well in FY '18, '19, and one of the larger peers entered into our territory and started undercutting on prices. We couldn't increase our ASP. Like if I look at '17, '18 and '19, the ASPs were largely practiced at around about INR125. And in '23, again, we saw similar things. So should we consider Relaxo as more of a volume plus operating leverage story and less of a branding story? Because it looks like despite being a large footwear brand, we do not hold the pricing power. Is that understanding correct? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.992)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, no. Last year, it was a totally different scenario because of the raw material volatility, not a because of any brand problem because when the material that we've got at INR 300, and then it falls to INR 150 and local market was able to get at lower. So they got for some time, some edge, I mean, competitive edge. But now things have stabilized. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: That's correct. But we had to roll back the prices, right, at least in open footwear, which is 75% of our portfolio? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.966)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Because the cost of raw materials which was just too much. That was the reason. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Okay. Second question is on the price infiltration by the wholesaler. We did get some feedback in the market. The wholesalers were kind of leading to some price infiltration for Relaxo. And we were taking some corrective actions in terms of installing software at the distributor level. Has -- any thoughts on it? And have we done the implementation on the IT part? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.958)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We have implemented DMS (Distributor Management System). Right now, it is the second version. First version was implemented 3 years back. And the latest version 2.0 is -- out of 700 infiltration by the distributors or wholesalers. It's a continuous process. It cannot stop. We have to really -- the help of technology control this. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: But any time line or deadline we have like where we will be done with this complete installation across all 650 distributors? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: So there is any question from Akhil or… 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Yes, yes. So my question was on the deadline, what kind of a deadline we are planning to install this DMS 2.0 across all our 650 distributors? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: By this year end, we'll complete this full implementation of DMS 2.0. And whatever complaints we get from distributor or wholesalers, we are taking appropriate actions for infiltration. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: This should kind of create price parity for the wholesaler and the distributor, right, because of this? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Correct, correct. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Okay. And last on the capacity and capex guidance, if you can. What capacity do you stand at? And for FY '24, what kind of capex we are envisioning? That's all from me. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: We already have good capacity. So last year, we spent a lot of money on the capacity enhancement. So this year, we don't have any big plan, but definitely, routine capex, molds and some repairs and some infrastructure creation that will be there. But already, we have good capacity to capture the demand of next 2 years at least. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Yes. In absolute term, like where do we stand in capacity? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Absolute terms, we have a capacity of 10 lakh per year. And last year being a tough year, so that utilization was around 50% - 55% at company level.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: So just wanted to understand the long-term vision, where do we want to see ourselves in the closed footwear category and in the next 5 years. So how much should be the sports footwear as a percentage of revenue share? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I think we are thinking of having at least double-digit growth for the next 5 years. And overall share of shoe business will definitely increase because of the -- the way we see things, growing use of athleisure. But it would be maybe 30% of share of shoes in our scheme of things. But otherwise, also -- other segments are also important, and they are also growing. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala 
Text: Okay. So sir, in -- if we try to understand the demand scenario in both open and closed footwear, how would you see whether it is robust? Or it is still muted? Some color on demand outlook that you are witnessing in different regions? goes negative. So whatever categories we are going to win, we have to be watchful of these things. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Prerna Jhunjhunwala

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Yes. I have a couple of questions. So you indicated we have three brands, and there is a pricing pressure which we may face at the lower end of the brand like Relaxo, basic chappals. How would you say our pricing -- we will have some -- relatively, we will have a stronger pricing power in terms of -- to get the pricing from the customer for a brand like Sparx or for Hawaii or Bahamas? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Because our brands are quite strong, even the old brand like Relaxo, as old as 40 years old. But at the same time, we have to be mindful that market is competitive and our pricing has to be competitive. We have to serve quality footwear at affordable price, then only you can sell large volumes of product. And that is what we are following. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.742)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Okay. So can you share like for the open footwear, what would be the realization for the, say, slipper for -- like how would you -- for us, what will be the average realization for open footwear for Sparx versus for Relaxo? Our realization... 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, no. You are comparing Sparx slippers with Relaxo slippers. They are totally different technology, different things. You can't compare those slippers with this. I think you want to know the price, Relaxo, it will be around INR 100. Do you want to know slippers? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Yes, only open footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Open footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: The idea is that -- what I'm trying to say is that it's a more aspirational product. So coming to the next question is that how do we see -- like Sparx is a much more aspirational product. So what is our now a plan for Sparx over the next 4 to 5 years? One of the participants also asked that we have 400 EBOs. Is there a possibility or a potential that we can rebrand those stores as a Sparx stores and to really get the mileage for the Sparx as a brand? of the stores, not all because we have to sell or showcase all our categories across whether it's our Flite brand, Bahamas brand, Relaxo brand. That's it. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jasmine Surana 
Text: Okay. And so I just wanted to understand since we've seen so much of volatility in the EVA prices in the last year, are there any plans for that to be hedged against those prices in the coming years or so?

Speaker: Abhishek Gadve 
Text: Right. And my next question is on the EVA pricing, the EVA prices. Last time -- in the last quarter, I remember when I asked, they were around INR 200 per kg, I think, if I remember correctly. What are the prices looking right now? And do we expect them to fall even further going forward? And -- or do we expect them to rise back to INR 200 levels? Or do we see that there is stabilization now at least for the next couple of quarters? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.987)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

And do you think market share's regain for organized players like you will be higher in open footwear, while imports could also be tough in the sports footwear category from 1st of July? There could be inventory disruptions for importers. And in Sparx also, we could see some market share gains? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. For the time being, the quality control standard certification has been laid out. And the real possibility that this date is going to be extended because even government is not ready. And meanwhile, a lot of clarifications are required from our side, and we have raised the queries to BIS. So accordingly -- but we are internally -- whatever quality specification they have laid down, whatever it is in the making, we are already meeting those standards. Nothing to worry. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: So I agree, nothing to worry, but will you gain share because your competitors may not be ready and you might be ready? So it will be beneficial for you. How do you think if those standards are laid out immediately and you can gain share? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Thank you, Ali. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining the Q2 and H1 FY2023 earnings call of Relaxo Footwears Limited. We have already uploaded our earnings press release and presentation at the exchanges, and we hope you have got an opportunity to review them. Before we open the floor for question-and-answer session, I would like to take you through an overview of the numbers of Q2 and H1 FY2023. During Q2 FY2023, the company reported total revenue of Rs.670 Crore as compared to Rs.714 Crore in Q2 FY2022, registering a decline of 6.3% year-on-year. The performance remained subdued mainly on account of fall in volumes in Q2 FY2023 in the categories serving the masses. With consumer facing inflationary pressures affecting affordability, there has been a shift in consumer habits as they moved towards cheaper alternative at the cost of quality. This prompted the company to take an aggressive price correction in September 2022 to remain competitive in the current market. This price specialization approach has been welcomed by distributor and customer, which would help us clear high-cost inventory in the coming quarter and ultimately improve our volume number going ahead. EBITDA in Q2 FY2023 was at Rs.59 Crore as compared to Rs.117 Crore in Q2 FY2022. This degrowth in EBITDA was mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices. EBITDA margin during the Q2 FY2023 was at 8.9% and declined by 748 bps year-on-year. The profit after tax was at Rs.22 Crore in Q2 FY2023 as compared to Rs.69 Crore in Q2 FY2022. Moving to our H1 FY2023 performance, the total revenue was at Rs.1,337 Crores and grew by 10.3% year-on-year as compared to Rs.1,212 Crore in H1 FY2022. EBITDA was at Rs.146 Crores from Rs.183 Crore in H1 FY2022. The company reported a profit after tax of Rs.61 Crore in H1 FY2023 as compared to Rs.100 Crore in H1 FY2022. Strong fundamentals complemented by wide distribution reach, strong brand recall and better sourcing capability we are optimistic about overcoming this tough phase and focus on delivery, steady revenue growth in both domestic and export going forward. Thank you. Now we can open the floor for questions.

Text: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question and answer session. Anyone who wishes to ask the question may please press star and 1 on the attached telephone. If you wish to put yourself in question que you may press star and 2. The first question is from the line of Gaurav Jogani from Axis Capital. Please go ahead 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Thank you for the opportunity Sir, my first question is with regards to the sharp volume decline that we have seen, and you have also mentioned that you have taken aggressive price cut in September 2022. So, one, if you can highlight what is the quantum of the price cut that you have taken, and how much of that has impacted the initial volumes? Because we understand that your distributors would have destocked initially, and because of which also there will be some volume impact. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, I am Ramesh Kumar Dua this side. Just in the background, I want to tell you a few things. The main cause of our price increase in the past 1.5 year had been some of the raw material polymers like EVA, PVC, polyethylene, they have started gradually rising and kept on rising to an extent, the thing which we were getting at Rs.120 a kg, reached Rs.300 kg, and then this started falling also, and it came down to Rs.160. So, in such kind of volatile situation, where our company has to maintain a long supply chain because materials are imported, it has to be at least 6 months’ supply chain. So when the things arise, then it is beneficial for the entire trade company and our customers. But when there is sudden fall, which historically, at least I have never witnessed. Such a fall from Rs.300, to become Rs.160, and local market becoming cheaper than the international market at which we got. Our way of pricing the products have been based on our costing. But now during this period, when the local raw material prices became lower than our cost prices, the local industry or other people who are always sourcing the material from local sources, they became competitive and also the affordability of the mass segment, that has been affected because of inflation all around. As a result, for our mass customers, they started shifting to cheaper products, never mind the quality, whether it lasts 2 months or 3 months, they are not bothered. They just want to while away this difficult period, which they are facing for inflation. So when the prices were rising gradually, we are forced to revise the prices upward. But when the raw material started falling or it became cheaper to the competition, they reacted very fast. But as far as our company is concerned, which has a long supply chain, we took our own time. Meanwhile, because of unaffordability of our article to the masses, they went for cheaper alternative. So that started affecting our sales. Now in the month of September, we have made some price correction so that we are competitive in the market. Never mind, it will affect our bottom line, but to be in the market, have volume sales, that is a kind of cautious call to maintain our market share in the market. So that has been the reason. Otherwise, if I want to tell you the gravity of the thing, EVA polymer, we are consuming around 1,000 tonnes per month that is in a year, 12,000 tonnes, and the material of this, which was Rs.120 kg, last year it became average Rs.210, you can see a difference of Rs.100 kg, 12,000 tonne, Rs.120 Crores for single material, and even in another 6 months, this year also, our average has been Rs.240. So this is the magnitude, which we say average is Rs.240, but in local it became Rs.160, so they became more competitive. We took this aggressive step to be competitive, but in the coming months, all those things are not still stabilized, the Rs.160, which was coming to local now it has become Rs.200. So things are very volatile. We are keeping an eye in the market, and we will keep on taking timely corrections, keeping in view of how the other markets are reacting. That is it. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.958)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Just to follow up on this one. So one, what is the magnitude of price cut that you have taken in September, and second thing, now because you are saying the local markets, again, that price has become Rs.200 per kg, and you might be having some inventory because of this. So now does that place you better versus the competition because you have some earlier inventory also with you? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. Generally, our supply chain is around 6 months. The price correction has been around 15% to 20%. Our main segment that is affected is Hawaii and EVA segment. Other PU related footwear and Sparx shoe that is not affected. That has grown and it is okay also. It is only where EVA polymer is being consumed, they are in our Bahamas brand, and Relaxo and also Flite EVA category. There, our company has suffered because of this volatility. Even earlier, we were able to predict what will be the price of this material next year. But now our purchase department is not able to tell in guarantee what is going to be the price next quarter, such is the kind of volatility and instability. Under such volatile chaotic conditions, things have become quite challenging, and now we are keeping a close watch on the market and taking timely corrections, not based on our costing, but based on market conditions. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Sure sir, One last question from my end. What dichotomy we are seeing in terms of consumption in footwear at least that the premium and the mid-premium segment continues to grow well. You have highlighted that for you the Sparx and the sports shoes are relatively unimpacted. So according to you what is driving this difference? Wherein the sports shoes and the higher segment is growing, but people are not able to afford being the lower end of the segment. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Well, you all know richer are becoming richer and poorer are becoming poorer. This mass segment, his affordability has been affected, and that was quite a big share of our business. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.993)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Plus rural market in India, they are really suffering, if you read the Economic Times today also even Hindustan Lever is taking heat because of a lot of inflation in rural market. So the purchasing power in rural market is more affected than urban India. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Sure. Sir, anything that you are doing in terms to cater to the demand that is shifting towards, I would say, to the premium and the mid-premium segment. So what is the company’s efforts on the same and how the company is looking to make more from it?\ 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are focusing on our other categories, which are doing well. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: There has been some disturbance, we will be reconnecting again. Ladies and Gentleman thank you for patiently holding, we have line of management reconnected, over to you sir. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I think I have concluded we can go to next question. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you, the next question is from the line of Bharat Chhoda from ICICI Securities Limited. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: Thanks for the opportunity Sir, Our cost of goods sales for per pair has been around Rs.60, Rs.65 over the last few quarters or so, and then probably this quarter, it has gone to Rs.88 per pair. So in the ensuing quarters, do you see like in Q3, Q4, that could come down to between Rs.75, Rs.80 or even lesser than that? Do you see that possibility? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.696)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. Although raw material conditions are quite volatile, but we have a long supply chain, and we have a lot of goods purchased at higher prices, Last year also we are carrying inventory. But in this quarter, that is October, November, December, all that old inventory will be flushed out, and January, February, March, there, our cost of production will be definitely low, and things will be better. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: So probably from Q4 onwards, we would see normal gross margin things returning? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Since we started improving, topline will start improving, but at the same time, we have to keep ourselves competitive, relevant as per the market. We have to be very watchful, what is the affordability of the mass segment. Accordingly, we have to take corrective action timely. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: So this high-cost inventory will be there for one more quarter at least? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, at least. This quarter, it will be flushed out, by November or maybe December by all means. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: Ok, Our raw material prices, what was the peak level that was there and from a percentage increase on a Y-o-Y basis, and from there, how much it has fallen down right now? If you could give a benchmark on that. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, it was Rs.120, it gone up to Rs.300, now it has become Rs.200. That is the kind of volatility you can understand, consuming 1,000 tonnes a month, you can understand the volatility and the affect. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.981)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: How is this higher-end segment doing like you said it is growth in that. So what growth are we witnessing in the shoe segment? Any color you can provide on that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, Gaurav will tell regarding sales figures of it. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So in shoe division, our growth in last 6 months is around 30%. So there is a healthy growth coming in shoe division, which is sports shoes and sports sandals. So that has grown well, but open footwear, which is Hawaii that has degrown. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: So what is the quantum of degrowth over there, Hawaii? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: That is also around 20%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: This you are speaking in terms of volume, sir? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Value. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: Thanks a lot for answering my question. Thank you sir.

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Naysar Parikh from Native Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Naysar Parikh 
Text: Hi, Thank you for the opportunity, my question is in continuation to what we have asked earlier, if you can just break up your volume or revenue, and just give us some directional view in terms of how is the performance of some of the lower-end categories or price points versus some higher-end categories? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Actually, the out-of-home category, which is sports shoes, formal slippers that has grown well and indoor, like we have Hawaii and Flite EVA, that has degrown. So now after lockdown, there has been a shift, people are going for more premium out-of-home categories. So that is growing well. But in Hawaii segment, we are feeling the heat here. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Naysar Parikh 
Text: Out-of-home would be what percentage of your revenue? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: See, in out-of-home also like we have Flite category in which we have EVA and PU, so PU is more than 50%, so that is growing more. If you say open footwear. But if you add Sparx, Sparx is also giving more than 41% contribution to our total business. That is growing at around 30%. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Naysar Parikh 
Text: What would be the average selling price for the Sparx category and the shoes category? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Every category is different, like sports shoe has around 800 plus ASP and sandal is around 500-plus ASP. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Naysar Parikh 
Text: Okay, I will join back in the queue. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Priyam Khimawat from ASK Investment Managers. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: Just wanted to understand, you alluded that price of polyurethane has moved from Rs.120 to Rs.300 per kg and then again falling back to Rs.200 per kg. What percentage of raw material is this for us? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: What you want to know, consumption of the material? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: Breakup of a raw material in terms of what percentage of raw material is this component? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: That is different in category-wise, you are not able to make anything out of it. I just told you, our total consumption of this polymer is around 1,000 tonnes a month, and the volatility has been Rs 120 to Rs 300 and then Rs 300 to Rs 200. 20% is consumption of EVA in the total cost of the materials. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: And if you could give some color on what are the other components in our raw material? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: There are so many other materials. The EVA is there. The PVC is there. These are the major polymer, natural rubber is there. PPDM is there. There are host of so many materials. But the main reason has been too much fluctuations on these 3-4 for key materials, EVA, PVC, low- density polyethylene, and some natural rubber that is all. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: Sir, you alluded to a 6-month supply chain cycle in most of the raw materials imported. Now that we have seen that this raw material can be so highly volatile, anything we are doing to reduce this import component and reducing the supply chain? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.798)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We cannot depend upon local sources. Otherwise, our factory will not be able to run. Local source, availability is only meant for small manufactures. If we go to the market, the rate will get out of control because of the local market, because our 1,000 tonnes, nobody can match. So we have to maintain this supply chain so that there is no disruption in the manufacturing process. It is only this onetime in life phenomenal, things have fallen otherwise it has always kept our company in a very healthy position, and it has been always beneficial. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.472)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: And did I hear it right that Sparx is currently at 41% revenue contribution and it is growing at around 30% for us? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Right. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: So despite that 41% component growing at 30%, our sales have declined around 7% this quarter. So the other part, which is 60% has declined, that steeply. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes,. You are right. So there is a factor, the Hawaii factor, the EVA factor, what we are doing in Hawaiian and Flite that has degrown a lot. So whatever gains we are getting from shoes division is getting nullified. So it is why the 10% growth is coming, and in this quarter, it was not that also because of too much rains and the market was not responding. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.896)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: Understood, and our ASP right now is trending at around 169. because 41% is sparx, you valuded to 800 ASP and 500 ASP for sports shoes and sandals, respectively? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We need to correct that, that is 800, if you take as a Sparx, we have 437 as ASP, 450, you can say. It has Rs.450 all categories put in Sparks. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: Understood, so going ahead, should we assume that since Sparx is growing at such a high pace, and ASP structurally will move towards Rs.200 to Rs.250 in the coming years? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It will be increasing, but by how much we have to see. ASP will increase. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: Okay sir, got it, that is all from my side. Thanks.

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Harsh Shah from InCred. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh Shah 
Text: Sir, my question is we have made a press release where we have stated that we have canceled some 15,000 stock option under our ESOP plan to 5 employees because of their resignation. So just wanted to enquire are these senior, mid-senior level exits and when have they resigned? What is that perspective, sir? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: We gave the ESOP to our AGM and above. There are 110 people in that category. So out of these 5 people have left the company and one was retirement case. So these are the senior mid-level, you can say. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh Shah 
Text: So this is basically exit by retirement? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Some retirement and some people left voluntarily. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh Shah 
Text: Okay, thank you for clarifying that and secondly, sir, what is our current capacity of Sparx, and what will be our capacity of Sparx in the next 2 years? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Currently, it is around 50,000 pairs a day of Sparx and which we are increasing the production to 100,000 pairs a day. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.698)

Speaker: Harsh Shah 
Text: And that will be operationalize by what time, sir? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Next April onwards. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh Shah 
Text: So we should be able to double our capacity in next 6 months, basically? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Correct. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh Shah 
Text: And Sir, then what would be our Capex outlay for FY2023? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: FY2023, our Capex will be around Rs.120 Crores to Rs.140 Crores because we have already placed the order, it is in pipeline, and we have added some back-end operations, and including all these molds and so many other expenses on building part, it will be in the range of Rs.140 Crores, you can say, for FY2023. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh Shah 
Text: Okay, thank you so much sir. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Aliasgar Shakir. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Thanks a lot sir, a couple of questions. First is on your sportswear. So, if my understanding is correct, out of about 20% of closed footwear, about 50% is sports and athleisure, right, which should be ballpark around Rs.250-odd Crores. So just wanted to understand, what are our plans there? A few of the recently listed companies and in fact, overall market, also a lot of smaller players have rapidly grown in the recent past. So, what are our plans here? we recently also added capacity in the sportswear. So how do we plan to grow this business over the next probably 3 years, if you could share your insights. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, this sports shoe segment this divided into online sale and distributor sales, the channel sale. So, in both channels, we are seeing a good demand coming from the market, and that is why we have added the capacity there only. And we are adding more designs every year, like this year also we have added a lot of designs and we are giving a lot of trust to a placement of products in the market. So, we are expecting a good growth coming from these Sparx segments specially sports shoes. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Ok, So, could you share what is our plan over 3 years, if you could share some number what growth we can expect here given that there are players who have reached up to Rs.50-100 Crores revenue, and we certainly have a very deep distribution reach. So we should be able to use our existing distribution reach or sportswear requires a different reach and therefore, it should be a very slow growth business. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.959)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: No, this would not be a slow growth. We are growing at 30%, and we will continue to grow more than 30% year-on-year in this category, and the demand will come from both channels, online, offline both. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: And is the number that I shared about Rs.250-odd Crores from the sportswear number correct? Or is my understanding... 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: That is only typical sport shoes, which we did last year, Rs.250 Crores. So definitely it will grow from here. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Understood, and just second question is on the inventory situation. So given the fact that you have taken price cuts, you would obviously have a lot of inventory yet in the system, which is at a higher price point. So by when do you expect that inventory to get unwind, and then you should only have one price point or lower price point inventory available in the market. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: At company level, by December end, we will be able to clear almost all the inventory of old prices, but it will go through the retail and that will take 1 to 2 months more at the retail level. So it is a long supply chain. Company can get over quickly. But at retail and distributor level, it takes time, maybe 2 to 3 months more, so by March it will be everywhere new prices. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: So, so far, whatever is the current price point, we should be able to normalize our inventory by probably March unless seeing some more volatility. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: From company point of view, by this December, it will be clear. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aliasgar Shakir 
Text: Got it this is very helpful Sir. Thank you so much. I will come back in the queue. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.991)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you. We will move on to the next question that is from the line of Ankit Kedia from Phillip Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Sir, the price cuts are 15% to 20%, which you alluded in the open footwear category, is it in line with the raw material price deflation what we have seen, or the price cuts are more towards volume protection and not towards RM fall which you have seen from average perspective? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.813)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Price revision has been taken keeping a view of the local market conditions, affordability of the consumer and what is the competitive environment. To be competitive, we have brought these prices, and we have to always remain competitive in the market. That is what we have done. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.772)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Is it fair to assume that the price cut is more than the RM deflation, which we have seen in the market and hence, the gross margins could bleed actually because of this? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, this gross margin under pressure until December. It will start looking up in January onwards. But one thing I must tell you, the raw material situation is very volatile. We cannot even predict in January, February, March at what rate we will be buying. Based on whatever we have in supply chain and what we are making current buying arrangements from international suppliers, we are able to tell today. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.948)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Sir, let me put it the other way. So if the RM increases, we will continue to maintain our prices to gain volumes and not increase our prices further... 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: That is a very strategic view point you are raising. You need to watch the market condition at the same time. Whatever is the market environment accordingly, we have to respond. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Sure. Sir, my next question is on your sports footwear. So from the current MBO retail network, how much is for the close sports footwear, if you can share that, and over the next 2 years, because we are expanding capacity, how much is coming predominantly for online? Are we going to have a differential product like some of our competitors have for online, where we will focus more or it is going to be fungible between online, offline as the demand comes in? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Currently, we have same portfolio, but going forward, we will have different portfolio, especially SMUs for e-commerce and different products for the offline because we want to control the price, there is sometimes a lot of price war. One channel give you more discount what we have heard in this Big Billion Days. So we are going to change our strategy and making SMUs for online channel. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: And sir, how many exclusive MBOs do we have for Sparx out of the 60,000 retailer network which we have? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: You are talking about wholesale or you talking about our own retail outlets? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: How much for wholesale, sir? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Wholesale, what we have, we are going currently 50,000 to 60,000 outlets. We have a data of 90,000 outlets. In that 10,000 outlets we are covering through Sparx. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: And so over the next 3 years, what is the target? What is the potential for Sparx for these outlets you feel given that open footwear will obviously be more, and how do you plan to target the South and West market for Sparx? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Sparx does well in South and West. Already, we are doing good in the South and West. Now we have to do good in East and North, other way around, and these 10,000 outlets definitely increased to 15,000 to 18,000 outlets in the next 3 to 4 years? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: And sir, one last question on the online side. Last year was around 12% of your revenues. What is the target given that the strategy is going to be more focused on online over the next 2 years, predominantly for the closed footwear contribution from online? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: See 12% is all brands put together. But if you take Sparx, it will be more than 20% - 25%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: And over the next 2 years, sir, what is the target given that you will spend more on online? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Definitely, this 12% contribution will increase to roughly around 15% in 2 to 3 years’ time, and this 25% will also increase what Sparx we are doing. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Sure, that is helpful sir. Thank you so much and all the best. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.99)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mithun Soni from GeeCee Investments. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Just wanted some clarifications. So how much of our revenue comes from the EVA-based product? Because that is where, from what we understand, is where the maximum pressure has come because of the long supply chain? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: EVA consuming is around 50% to 60%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: And out of the 50% to 60%, how many of this business would be like where we had reasonably priced products like Hawaiis of the world and it is at the mass segment because that is where you would have faced most of the pressure or you have faced the pricing pressure even in the Hawaii category? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have faced this pricing pressure at the Hawaii which comes under brand Relaxo and Bahamas, and also EVA coming under Flite brand. These 2 categories we have faced this problem. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: And the price correction, 15% has been taken across the entire portfolio of 50% or 60% of the EVA products? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.535)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: EVA and Hawaii segment, we have done the correction. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: PU and Sports shoes, we have not done any correction. So for 50% of the products of the total sales, 50%, which is that we have taken a correction. For the PU wear, Sports and Sparx, we have not taken any price correction. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: And one more very important element we are missing is that GST has increased from 5% to 12%. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Correct. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So that also has impacted a lot, in this lower segment 5% to 12%, that has also impacted, raw material plus GST. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Correct. The second thing, like as one of the participants asked that there is a clear shift what we are seeing that the premium, semi-premium has been doing well and versus the mass segment has been facing the pressure, and there is the market which is moving over there? So what are the things we are doing to promote and to expand the share of the semi-premium and the premium category for us? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are increasing the capacity of our sports shoe manufacturing capacity, we are doubling up the capacity, and we are also focusing on online sales. Online sales is maximum of premium and these segments only, not slippers or low price articles. That is what will do. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: How are the priced Hawaii, they are also priced semi-premium or even they are also priced at the mass pricing? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Hawaii is meant for mass segment. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Ok, So 50% of our business comes from the premium and the semi premium segment is the way to look at it? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, almost. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: And given that we have our own 400-store outlet distribution, any plans on that front, what are the things we are looking to do over there to promote our products in the premium category? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Well, our retail outlets, they are doing well, and we are trying to see if need be, we will do the expansion on that front. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Ok, but you are looking to do expansion in that front? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are watching now how much business we can extract. After all, retail is contributing to around 8% of the business. So strategically, our idea of putting a retail outlet had been to focus all of our products so that we understand what is the consumer behavior and then we spread across multi-brand outlets. It is just 8% to 10% of the business. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Correct, thank you very much sir. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Divyata Dalal from Trident Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Divyata Dalal 
Text: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to understand what would be the breakup of open footwear and close footwear in our revenue for 6 months? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It is same like what it was last year. It is around 80% open and 20% closed. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Divyata Dalal 
Text: So Sparx would be a part of the close footwear or some part of it will also be open? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, it has both. It has open and closed. Both. Open is sandals and close is sports shoes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Divyata Dalal 
Text: Ok fine, and in terms of our press release, we have mentioned that since we have taken the price cut, it has been welcomed by trade and consumers. So are we seeing some volume uptick till now in Q3, like have you seen after taking price cut in September? Has there been some increase in volume on the Hawaii side? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, it is happening and in the month of November it would be much better. Because there is old inventory in the system, it will take some time, but things are very promising. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Divyata Dalal 
Text: So in terms of volume for next quarter also, we can assume that 80-20 would be the breakup of open and close? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Divyata Dalal

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh 
Text: Hi Sir, So traditionally, we have been strong in the northern and the eastern market. However, in the Sparx category, we are just starting in the northern and eastern markets. So are we facing some headwinds in these 2 markets? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Can you repeat the question? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh 
Text: Yes, the traditional Relaxo has been very strong in the northern and the eastern market. However, in the Sparx sports shoes category, we are just starting off. Majorly, our revenue is coming from South and the Western market. So what are the specific headwinds that we have faced in these 2 markets? Why are we not take right now in the Northern and the Eastern market in Sparx sports shoes? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: North also we are focusing, and North is little more competitive market than South and West. All manufacturing ways of footwear is this side. In North, West and South, there were no manufacturing basis of sports shoes and all that. So we got an easy entry into that market. But here, it is in the north side, environmentally, it is more competitive. But we are focusing, and things will be improving here also. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Harsh

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Akhil Parekh from Centrum Broking. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: My first question, would you be able to quantify how much of the EBITDA margin erosion in the first half of the year is because of the inventory losses? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: There is no effect of inventory on the EBITDA margin, it is mainly raw material prices, that is hitting. Otherwise, generally, we never sell below cost. It will never happen. So we either decrease the prices, but it is never below the cost. So impact upon EBITDA is mainly due to the raw material prices. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.977)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Ok got it, the price hikes we took last year, right, and the channel feedback was suggesting that some of our bigger competitors have not taken the hikes in context to what Relaxo took. So has the shift happened from Relaxo to the other big competitors? Or have they gone largely to the unbranded side? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.985)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It is mostly unbranded who were offering cheaper products, cheaper quality and since the affordability of the consumer has gone down. So for the time being, they shifted because their affordability was not there. That was one of the reasons. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Okay. So we have not lost market share to any of our bigger competitors, right? Would that be a fair understanding? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, no, not at all. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Okay. Third and last question, on the volume front, if I look at volumes from FY2019 and probably for next year as well, broadly, they have stagnated at around 17 to 18 Crores, 19 Crores. Is there any saturation which we are seeing in terms of volume growth because the volume growth is missing, I understand the pandemic was there, but which has been actually good for us. But if I look at last 5 years trend FY2019 to, say, 2022, 2023 as well, the volumes are, by and large, muted. So anything if you can highlight on that? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: When people were not moving around, outdoor footwear was really totally stagnant or lowest. But this indoor footwear, were more. In a lockdown, there were a lot of people who are out, walking, going to villages and all of sudden too much demand had emerged. That was one of the reasons. But now I do not say, maybe this year things were stagnated. But next year, again, we will have growth. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Like peak volumes we did in FY2021, which is around 19-odd Crores, so would it be fair to say we will probably cross that number in, say, FY2024, that is next year? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I hope so. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Okay sir got it, that is all from my side, and best wishes for coming quarters.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Anush Mokashi 
Text: Yes. Sir, my question is around EBOs. So basically, what we are looking at is there is a decline in the EBOs those 398 as of March 2021, those have declined to 388 as of Q2. So can you please help us understand the reasons behind that? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. We generally are maintaining at 400. But sometimes, a few stores which are not doing well then, we rationalize and then we put out stores. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Anush Mokashi 
Text: Can you share any guidance on the EBOs side over the next few years? How much are we looking at? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are presently maintaining around 400. That is what we would like to have this year, 400. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Anush Mokashi 
Text: Essentially, do we have any plans to go international in EBO if you have any guidance on that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are already exporting. Our share of export is around 4%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Anush Mokashi 
Text: Opening up of maybe Sparx EBO. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, no. Internationally, we are not opening any EBOs. It is only domestic that we have exclusive for our brand outlets. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: But as our test marketing, what we are doing is, we are opening the stores into countries through our distributors to check the consumer taste there of our styles that we are promoting there that we are doing in few countries, and eventually, we will take a call how to go about it. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Anush Mokashi 
Text: I am assuming that EBOs margins at the distributor level are much high here than the MBOs or the retail outlets we have. Am I right in that condition? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: You mean multi-brand outlets or exclusive brand outlets, what do you say. How many number of you want to know? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Anush Mokashi 
Text: No. My question is around the margins. Basically, the margins which we get at the EBO level the distributor margin. Those are much higher in EBOs compared to the MBOs. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Definitely, margins are higher, but because you have to do so many expenses, rent and staff and so many things, so MBO is a different model, they have their own shop or just proprietor running the shop. So we give margin around 30% to the MBO and then they pass on some discount and they are earning around 25% - 30%. So that is more profitable but in case of EBO, definitely, there are margins are high, but expenses are also high. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Anush Mokashi 
Text: Okay thank you so much sir, that is it from my side.

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manish Poddar from Motilal Oswal AMC. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: A couple of questions. First is, what is the total Capex for FY2024 and 2025? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: FY2024, FY2025, see we have been spending around Rs.80 to Rs. 100 Crore every year. So this year, FY2023, we have planned around Rs.140 Crores. So 2024 and 2025, it should be between Rs.80 to Rs. 100 Crore. It is an ongoing Capex, we always have to expand. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: And when you say you have not lost market share, how do you get a gauge on that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.697)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Sorry, we have not lost the market share, next, what you are saying. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.586)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: You mentioned on the call that you have not lost market share. So I am just trying to understand how we get a gauge on that. You track shelf space, how do you get a sense of that. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.685)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We have our sales offices. We have more than 300 sales officers visiting 50,000 outlets. So we keep a track of the primary sales, the secondary sale, the shelf space and what we are seeing the volume degrowth in Hawaii and EVA category. So that clearly mentioned that the shelf has been taken by unorganized players. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.717)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: But now we are getting back. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Now we are getting back, yes, definitely, after taking price correction. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: And just one last one. So is the demand environment at the bottom of the pyramid really that bad because when you look at a couple of data points, let us say, price increase taken by mobile players or you look at a couple of online guys in apparel, doing very well, some of that thing does not add up. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes. Because if you just read today newspaper Economics Times, clearly mentioned Rural India Big Pressure by Hindustan Lever, ITC, all. Rural India is really under pressure there because of inflationary pressure, and urban India is doing really well that you can easily see that. All urban brands, urban consumption is there in mobiles or in automobiles. But rural India, we are seeing a sharp decline in consumption also. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: Fair enough. Thank you.

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhishek, an investor. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Abhishek 
Text: Thank you for the opportunity I have a couple of questions. My first question is around, as you mentioned, the opening remark, right, that the EVA prices in the domestic markets are around Rs.200 per kg. So does it mean that now there is an even playing ground for us and other unorganized players? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, now it is better because now after taking price correction, we are at same level because we are buying at Rs.200 and they are also buying at Rs.200. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Abhishek 
Text: Right, and are there any further price cuts expected by us? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: No, I do not think so. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Abhishek 
Text: So my next question would be around the Sparx brand. So is there any competition from the organized sector from other listed or other large players in the sector, in Sparx brand? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, there are a lot of organized players, and there is a competition, no doubt about it. But we have a different market, different product portfolio and the athleisure demand overall is increasing for every brand because the consumer trend is shifting to a fitness, lifestyle, health. So demand of athleisure footwear is going up, for the industry itself is going up. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: That is why we are doubling the capacity. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Abhishek 
Text: Got it, and my last question would be on the contribution of Sparx from its open footwear and from close footwear. Is the open footwear competition that is sandals much higher compared to sports shoes? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.986)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: No, the competition is in both levels, sandals, and shoes. It is not that competition is less in shoes or sandals. So it is an athleisure category. So it is a growing category and market is growing. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.996)

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tejash Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejash Shah 
Text: Just one question from my side. Usually, we have seen in a category where there is a large participation by unorganized sector. Inflationary period is always beneficiary for organized players because of the scale, ability to manage supply chain volatility and in procurement, planning, production. Understandably, they should have an upper hand versus unorganized players. So in our case, it did not play out like that. So just wanted to understand, was it different in our case or there were some more headwinds or unprecedented headwinds which did not allow us to capitalize on this opportunity? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.838)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: So as long as we were rising, we were in a better position. It is only because there was a decline of the price of our main material from Rs.300 to Rs.160. If you consume 1,000 tonnes a month, at that time, local market availability of the material came down at Rs.160 - Rs.180. But we have a long supply chain, which we are buying, and our average price was Rs.240 for the year. So it was just in this 3 - or 4-month period when they became advantageous because we have a long supply chain thereby supply short supply chain. But this happens once in a life that prices go down and they became advantageous. It is very rare phenomena. It is just a matter of time. Otherwise, we cannot be dependent at all on local sources. Our factory will come to a halt. To have uninterrupted, no disruption, manufacturing process, we have to maintain this sufficient inventory in the pipeline. During the lockdown period, even there was so much of scarcity of material and even getting containers to ship the material became a challenge. So that is why we took little abundant precaution and added a little more stocking also just to avoid any manufacturing disruption. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Tejash Shah 
Text: And sir, just expanding that point, what percentage of competition would be importing either raw material or finished goods from China, especially from unorganized? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I cannot comment on that. I can tell you about ourselves. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejash Shah 
Text: No, I was asking about unorganized, not organized, but anyways, thanks. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Unorganized, their figures are not at all available to anybody. I do not know even they pay GST to the government. I cannot say anything.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Thank you Akhil. Good afternoon, everyone. Ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the financial year 2021-22. We have already shared our earnings press release and result presentation. Hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q4 FY22 Financial Performance followed by full year FY22 Financial Performance. In Q4 FY22 Relaxo booked operating revenue of 698 crores as compared to Rs. 748 crores in the corresponding period of previous year. Revenue during the quarter was affected due to disruption caused by Omicron variant of COVID, GST rate hike from 5% to 12% w.e.f. January ‘22 on footwear priced below Rs. 1,000 and subdued demand due to high inflation. EBITDA during the quarter is at Rs. 111 crores as compared to Rs. 163 crores in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter is 15.9%. EBITDA margin decreased mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices and extra support provided to trade towards GST rate differential on inventory. Our profit after tax is Rs. 63 crores for the quarter as compared to Rs. 102 crores in the corresponding period of previous year. For FY2022 our revenues stood at Rs. 2,653 crores as compared to the Rs. 2,359 crores which is a growth of 12% year-on-year. The growth in revenue is achieved mainly due to calibrated price hike taken during the year to mitigate impact of high raw material prices. EBITDA is at Rs. 416 crores as compared to Rs. 495 crores in the previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the year is 15.7%. The decline in EBITDA margin is mainly on account of increase in raw material prices and normalization of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in FY22 as compared to FY21. Our profit after tax is Rs. 233 crores as compared to Rs. 292 crores during the previous year. During FY2022 we generated cash of Rs. 140 crores from operation and spent Rs. 140 crores in CAPEX. At the end of March 31st, 2022, we have 394 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 7% of our FY22 revenue. Export crossed Rs. 100 crores mark and is picking up with opening of market and its contribution is more than 4% of revenue of FY2022. Going forward we are cautious about our continual extraordinary inflation and remain cautiously optimistic on the basis of strong recovery across category, especially in the high-value closed footwear category after opening up of offices, schools, and colleges. We believe that we are well positioned in the footwear marketplace by providing the right price value equation to our customer while making sure our product remains affordable and accessible. We remain committed to all our stakeholders by creating a strong foundation for the future which can provide a sustainable and profitable growth for the long term. Thank you. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.

Text: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Tejas Shah with Spark Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Just will start with a couple of basic questions. If you can help us to understand the realization split increase which has happened between price increase and premiumization if any happened during the year and during the quarter? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Price increase, because this full year was lot of inflation, raw material prices went up. Price increase was in the range of 25% across all the categories, in few categories more and few categories less. This is majorly due to the price increase and product mix because closed footwear was sold much more as compared to FY21. That mix also happened in this year. Overall increase majorly is due to price increase. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: This 25% price increase would be at customer level, because of GST increase as well but that would not have totally reflected in our numbers, right? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.527)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: No, it's a mix of raw material and GST. GST came only in January ‘22 that was the last increase which we took but overall, from start of the year from May onwards raw material prices were going up so we took three to-four price increase in full year. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Second, though initial period yet, but almost 4-5 months have passed by after GST increase has happened. What is the initial feedback in terms of customer and both channel whether they have absorbed this price hike easily or it will take some more time for demand and channels to settle down on this? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.947)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, it's been 4 months you are right. What we are seeing is in first 2-3 months there was a pressure because it was new for the trade. So, there was a lot of resistance. People were talking about taking this price back from 12 to 5, they were giving lot of representation to the government but now it is settled. The rates have been settled. Post that there is definitely a pressure because of inflation, consumer sentiments are still not so great and whatever the pass on off price what we have done, or the industry has done its taking time for the consumer as well as for the trade to take it. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.959)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: The last one, based on the recent channel checks which has been done on the sector it has seen that there's a huge traction in online channel for closed footwear especially the sports footwear or athleisure footwear. So, have we seen any such traction in our number a) what was our exposure to online channel for the full year as a company and also within the Sparx brand in particular? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, Sparx brand has done very well in e-commerce platform and we can see the growth rate was more than 40% in e-commerce platform. There is a traction of a sports shoe selling more on e-com. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: What will be the total exposure of online as a channel for us? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We were last year around 10%, now it is 11.5%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: No. I'll come back in queue for follow-up questions on this. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jogani with Axis Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Thank you for taking my question. My first question is with regards to the RM inflation as you have highlighted. Is the bulk of the RM inflation now done or do we need to take further price increases to mitigate the RM inflation that we have seen? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.989)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Raw material situation continues to remain unpredictable. You cannot say for guarantee that everything is settled. Always we are getting news of different kinds, sometimes packing material, chemicals, polymers. So, things are not stable as yet, we can’t say confidently things are stabilized as far the raw material situation is concerned. But we have to be watchful of it and accordingly we have to see market dynamics also and accordingly keep on taking appropriate action. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.987)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: To put the other way round if assuming whatever the RM prices are today, does it cover whatever the price increases that we have taken as on today, RM price do we cover it or do we need to still take further pricing action to cover the impact? Because the impact on margin is huge as can be seen from the results. Still do we need to take more price increases to even cover today's RM inflation. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we have to wait and see all these things. Ultimately our goal at the moment is to focus on our market share in the market and keeping in view the article that we are in, which are meant for masses, lower rank of society. So that's very important that we will be keeping strict vigil on it and accordingly take appropriate actions at appropriate time. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: My next question is with regards to your volume if we see this particular year, so the volume this particular year has even seen a decline if we compare versus FY20. While I do agree that there was some impact during the first quarter due to Omicron and even this quarter was impacted. But how do you see the volume trajectory going ahead in the light of the sharp RM inflation that we are seeing given our target customer is very price sensitive? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Last year if you remember in May we had this Corona wave where everything was shut down and followed by January also we had a small Omicron variant coming in. So definitely there has been a pressure on volume in term, because last to last year the open footwear was selling a lot because people were at home and there was extraordinary sales happening on last-to-last year. So, to sustain that was a challenge. Going forward the consumer sentiments are still not so buoyant. We feel I think after maybe Quarter 1 the things will come back but very difficult to say right now because of unpredictable supply chain things are not settled, raw material prices are not settled but we are hoping that Quarter 2 onwards we can see some recovery. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.765)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: One last question from my end is regarding the sportswear segment. The sportswear or so to say the casual footwear segment has been seeing very good traction as such. In this light we have seen lately, one of our competitors getting listed on the exchange and they have been showing smart growth in Q4 as well. In that light if you see what is our action towards the sportswear segment what are we doing to address that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, we have three brands. Basically, for them it is athleisure brand what we hear. That is one third of our business. We are also seeing a good growth rate in athleisure and sports category. We are growing in line with the industry. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Anything that you're seeing, because on a general market check suggests that they are higher on the market share percentage-wise given that they are very dominant in that segment. Anything that we are doing in terms of product launches or expanding our reach on the online that you can highlight that we are increasing our presence there? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Definitely we are taking some steps. I think it's like for example we are increasing some A&SP spends on e-com and having new tie-ups with different channels also. So, it's a continuous process. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Our next question comes from the line of Bharat Chhoda with ICICI Securities. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: Generally, when we see Relaxo has a good working capital cycle of around 50 days but this time it appears to be on the higher side of it closer to 90 days. What is the reason for the same? Is it more of raw material being accumulated or is it the finished goods? Can you just provide a brief view on that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: This has been because there was a pressure upon sale and price also. Our inventory has increased abnormally more than expected and there are two reasons for the inventory increase, one is the pressure upon sale and also the prices because your cost of goods and everything has increased. So, it has also given a multiplying effect upon the inventory. That is the one reason. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.598)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: Your words were not clear. Could you please repeat? I was not able to get it. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Just repeating. Inventory is the major reason for working capital disturbance in this year and there are two reasons, one there was pressure upon the sale and second because the cost of goods has also increased, even raw material also. We were carrying little more inventory just to be more cautious about the future price increase, so inventory has increased in the balance sheet. That is visible also. Second, there is a slight increase in some debtors. So, these are the two reasons the working capital is under pressure. Ramesh Kumar Dua Material locked up includes raw material also. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.968)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: We have seen this the realization being significantly higher at this level do you see we would see we would see an impact on the volumes going ahead and probably also what is the margin we should work with? Is it 17%-18% kind of a margin that is possible for us to maintain with the current level ? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Margin definitely because this year being a little tough year comparatively and FY21 was a best year but if we compare FY20 the margins are definitely achievable, and we intend to and we are hopeful that will be achieved on FY20 base if you see. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: FY20 base is what we should work with for FY23? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Yes. We can say, FY20 was 17 and this year we achieved lower than that, so definitely we intend and it's possible also. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: At this level do you see the consumer actually like the volumes are they being impacted or how is it because that could you please provide a view on that how the consumer is reacting, the volumes have been down or how is it at this price levels? Initially there has been a comment from your side probably but post that stabilization is that volume again picking up? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.986)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: As you're well aware that because of inflation the purchasing power of the lower end of the pyramid, the mass market, they are feeling the pinch of inflation. Some of them are looking for cheaper alternatives you can understand because they have no money in their pocket. So, they are going for cheaper alternatives. There is a volume pressure no doubt about it. I think from Quarter 2 onwards this thing will be much better. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.818)

Text: Our next question comes from the line Mythili Balakrishnan with Alchemy Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: I just wanted to get a couple of data points from you. I want to go understand the mix between the different brands Sparx, Bahamas, Flite and the normal Hawai. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We are doing Hawai and Bahamas come under Hawai division. That is around 25% and Flite is 37.5% and similarly Sparx is 37.5%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: Within Sparx 50% were sandals and the rest 40% were the closed toes, has that portfolio changed in terms of the mix? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, it has changed now. It is 60% shoes and 40% sandal as athleisure growing tremendously. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: Are the sandals part of the business under pressure or both of them are doing well? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.988)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Both are doing well. The only thing is there is a good demand in athleisure and sportswear. That e-commerce is growing much faster because of India becoming more fit and demand of these products going high. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: Could you also help me understand the distributor and channel mix for us currently, how much EBO, online and wholesalers? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We have around 650 to 680 distributors and online contribute around 11.5% of our sales, 7% is contributed by retail and 4% by exports. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: My last question was on CAPEX. We have spent around 140 crores this year. Just wanted to get a sense of is some larger CAPEX in the footing given our venture into the south etc.? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: We don't have any intent to spend in south but definitely we are expanding our capacity in north where we have our own set up. So, we are integrating our backend operations and for that we are working. This year also we have intent to spend around INR 100 crores, so it will add to the backend operations mainly. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Our next question comes from the line of Manish Poddar with Motilal Oswal Asset Management. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: Just three questions. If you can help me with this extra trade support which you've given to the channel, how much is the quantum for that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Extra trade support we gave in Q3 because we were having inventory in December and GST was effective from January. In that quarter we gave around the INR 15 to 18 Cr because we were carrying some inventory at our end also, we gave the support in this quarter also. That is around INR 8 to 10 crores in this quarter. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: You said the prices in the channel now or the inventory in the channel liquidated or has got the new pricing, is that the fair understanding? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Now new price material is coming the market. So that old inventory is almost clear. So now everything is through in the system. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: Just two more data points if you can, you said now 650 odd distributors are there. How many distributors have we added in the full year? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: That is roughly around 10% what we have added. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: Just in terms of SKUs, would you be able to help me how many articles do we have and what is the addition on a YOY basis? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: 400 articles we have right now. If you talk about SKU, it is 12,257 SKUs we have. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manish Poddar 
Text: What is the change, is it the reduction in that because mainly it’s a reduction just wanted to understand what is the numbers say in from FY21? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: No there's no reduction in SKU. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Its around 10,000 to 12,000, generally it always keeps changing also, some articles are plus and some minus. It’s always changing but range is around 10,000 to 12,000. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Kanodia with Ambit Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: The first question is in terms of capacity addition, so in terms of volumes what is the capacity addition plan for the next 2 years and across which brands or categories will we be expanding those? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Already we have reached the capacity of 10 lakhs pairs per day and utilization is around 65% and within this category we are focusing to free some capacity of whatever is required in shoe division. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.988)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Second thing in terms of price hike, I think the full-year price hike was 25% but in terms of the price hike taken in 4Q apart from the 7% which you might have taken because of GST, was there any other price hikes as well? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.993)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: The last price hike we took in December. That was inclusive of GST as well as material impact also, so that was the last one. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Last question, there is an inflationary trend in RM prices but is there any disruption in the supply of RM as well or at least on the supply side that's not a challenge? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.912)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we are getting supplies. What we are doing is, we have maintaining inventory of the material because this uncertainty is always there. So, we have to keep some raw material in inventory for any possible disruption if it is there. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Just on the inventory side, is it possible to share out of the total inventory which we are carrying at the year end, what percentage would be pertaining to finish goods and what percentage would be of raw material? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Percentage, so overall maximum inventory related to FG (Finished Goods) because most of the materials we keep around 50 to 60 days inventory in the system but this time it was little higher. Average we keep around 40 days but this time it is higher. So, in percentage term you can say around one-third, around 30% will be raw material and rest is WIP and FG.

Text: Next question comes from the line of Nikunj Gala with Sundaram AMC. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikunj Gala 
Text: Just want to understand on the pricing front, you mentioned 25% increase which we have taken, this increase is at a consumer level or if I look at your realization increase on YOY basis for FY22, it is also nearly 22.7%. Similar kind of increase is also at a consumer level? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: On MRP you can say, consumer level, yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikunj Gala 
Text: Even at a MRP it’s a 25% increase on a YOY basis and this includes the GST increase also from 5% to 12%, right? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, but it depends upon category to category also. 75% across all categories, in some category more, some category less, so depends upon the raw material. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikunj Gala 
Text: If I look at our realization on a 3-year basis, it would be 7%. So just wanted to understand this 7% increase on a 3-year basis, how this muchhas impacted the consumer from the volume perspective because our volumes are down to 2% on a 3-year basis. Is that a very meaningful impact you are looking at the external environment that the demand has been impacted so much purely on account of this kind of a price increase? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The price increase has happened more in Hawai Slippers, Bahamas, and Flite EVA because they are having high content of polymers which became very expensive. Their price increase has been extraordinarily high and that has affected the demand of the articles. So the 25% what you are talking that average is across all categories. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.958)

Speaker: Nikunj Gala 
Text: I understand. Sorry to dwell more on this. Can you just help us with this, let's take an example of average, the large part of your chunk of your product would be selling at approximately Rs. 250-300 article at a consumer level. On that you have taken 20%-25% increase, so that 250 to 300 like Rs. 50 per pair would have such a deep impact on the volume just want to understand that. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.945)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, you're right. In some categories we can feel the heat that you are saying Rs. 50 increase is there. It has definitely affected some volume, but going forward this thing will improve because other people are also increasing their prices. It will take consumer some time to really adjust to the new prices. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikunj Gala 
Text: This last one question; on a very sustainable basis what kind of a working capital you think would be doable in the medium term? I understand this year it would be high on account of high RM but what is the target threshold level you work with? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.973)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Threshold from which angle, amount term or what you are saying? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikunj Gala 
Text: On a very sustainable working capital days 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.885)

Speaker: SushilBatra 
Text: Sustainable working capital, if it’s 3 months things are workable smoothly, 3-3.5 months maximum. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.953)

Speaker: Nikunj Gala 
Text: If I look 7-8 years where it was 2 months. Now we have shifted to 3 months kind of working capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Because this shoe category is growing much faster. It's a high value item, so it's lead time is much more, and we have to give little more credit to trade also because it is high value item. So that’s why it is increasing and moreover the raw material prices have also gone up like anything. So overall in value term it is definitely putting pressure upon the working capital side.

Text: Our next question comes from the line of Akhil Parekh with Centrum Broking Limited. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: My first question is on the price hike. What is the price differential now between Relaxo footwear and unbranded and some of our peers like Aqualite, VKC footwear? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Dua 
Text: Can you repeat the question, your voice we can't hear? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: I'll repeat my question. How is the price differential between the Relaxo versus our peer and versus the unbranded? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: What it was last year we have maintained the same gap. It is not that there is a huge gap in terms of what it was one year back. I can just say that we are always expensive than unorganized. You cannot compare brand with unorganized. It's very difficult because they do pricing on daily basis, so we do not do. It's very difficult to compare with the unbranded but if you talk about other brands whatever difference was there before it is same. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.956)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: And how much that would be roughly? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Depends upon brand to brand. There are so many other brands also. If you're talking about Aqualite, so 5% to 10% difference is always there. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Does that lead to downtrading, for example given that the unbranded is cheaper and they can sacrifice on quality. Have we seen a trend where consumers have shifted from the branded players to unbranded? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Some parts of India or you can say bottom of pyramid where people are feeling the heat of inflation a lot. They are doing it because again the money in the pocket, whatever money they have and it's getting depreciated, so they are going towards the unorganized. But that is a short- term phenomenon because the quality is not that good. They will come back to the brand. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.981)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: My second and last question is in terms of the retail touchpoint, if I look at fourth quarter ‘21 presentation, we said we had the 50,000 touchpoint and now we say we have 60,000 touchpoint. So, any specific geographies where we have added 10,000 outlets in last 1 year? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It is across actually, but major in west and south. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Our next question comes from the line of Nisarg Gandhi, an investor. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nisarg Gandhi 
Text: My first question is regarding how are the customers reacting to the significant price increase and will you be willing to reduce the prices if the raw material pressure softens which is something if I recall correctly, you have never done in the past? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to always remain relevant to the market conditions and also keep our prices competitive. Keeping in view our input cost we have to act accordingly and that will keep on happening. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Nisarg Gandhi 
Text: Do you see an increasing contribution from e-commerce like as high as 15% to even 20% from 11.5% this year in medium term and if you can outline what is your growth strategy for incremental sharing e-commerce? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: As everybody knows that digital is growing and e-commerce is the fastest growing category in footwear. 11% to 15% in one year will be difficult but we are definitely having high aspirations and we will grow to a good number. But it’s difficult to say right now if it will become 11% to 15% in just 1 year. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nisarg Gandhi 
Text: I was just looking to know more about the strategy that you are deploying to increase your revenue share from the e-commerce channels. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Strategy if you ask, we are going to increase the spends on the different channels be it e-com. That is one and we are going for SMUs or whatever products specific, whatever calls we have to take we are doing that, and we are adding more channels in that.

Text: Our next question comes from the line of Priyam Khimawat with ASK Investment. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: First you highlighted a sales mix as 25% in Hawai and Bahamas and 35% each in Sparx and Relaxo. So, was that volume break-up you are referring to or was that a value break-up? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: It’s a value break up. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: And how would the volumes be then? If you could share that please? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Volume generally we don't share but overall, Yes, maximum, Contribution comes from Hawai, Hawai is including Bahamas also and second is the Flite and last is Sparx. So, this is the breakup. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: Secondly on your price increases. You highlighted that our last price hike was in December ‘21. Right now, we are already in May and I assume that raw material prices would have further inched up from December up to now. Are we contemplating any further price increases in the near term or the increase taken in December was sufficient for us to maintain a margin at the desired level? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Currently we like to continue with what pricing has been already there. Let the things stabilize. Every now and then changing pricing destabilizes a market and creates lot of uncertainty. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.924)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: Can we see some pressure on margins then in Quarter 1-Quarter 2 because there will be a lag in price increases? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. That will be there. After all things are in the system, new things are getting adjusted, but things will improve in the next quarter. Maybe somewhat this quarter also. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: You highlighted our online share is 11.5% on the overall volumes. But if I take closed footwear category as a whole, what will be our online share there? I was just trying to understand are we in line with competition or ahead of them? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Can you just repeat your question? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: Our overall share in online is 11.5% as you highlighted. I just wanted to understand what would be the share in closed footwear category, sports, and athleisure primarily? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: If you talk about online, in Sparx 60% is shoes and 40% is sandals even in online. So, majority of sales are coming more than Rs. 500 MRP in online. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Priyam Khimawat 
Text: Let me put it other way. Out of that, in our Sparx brand, what would be the online contribution? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It’s more than 25%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Text: Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Umang Mehta with Kotak Securities. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Umang Mehta 
Text: In the online channel at the EBITDA level, considering that delivery and all those expenses as well; would it be profit making for the company? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.993)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We try to keep same margins what we have online-offline and retail. We last time also discussed that we do not want that goods flow from one channel to another because of prices. So, we keep it same. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Umang Mehta 
Text: Same margin you mean the gross margin, right? But considering the expenses of fulfillment of those orders, would you still be making same level of margins, EBITDA level? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: It’s the same. We just keep everything same. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Umang Mehta 
Text: Just one quick question on the geographic breakup. Would it be possible to share some broad numbers on region wise sales? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Our major sales come from North India that is around 50% and then 18% comes from East, same West 18% and around 13% from South.

Text: Our next question comes from the line of Deven Kulkarni with Marcellus. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Deven Kulkarni 
Text: Around 2 years ago our distributor count was around 800 and today it has come down to around 650. Why has the distributor count reduced over the last few years? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We want quality distributors so less than Rs.10 lakh sales per month. So, they were many in numbers. So, we have cut down the tail. We are focusing on the cost of reaching them it was not viable. We are focusing on good number of distributors who are doing more than Rs. 10 lakhs per month. That is how we decided. It was a tail. We have to cut the tail. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Deven Kulkarni 
Text: Is this exercise now over or it is a work in progress? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Can you repeat? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Deven Kulkarni 
Text: Is this exercise of cutting the distributors over or it is still work in progress? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It is a continuous process. We add 50 or we remove 25 who are not performing. So, it's a continuous process. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Deven Kulkarni 
Text: Secondly your presentation says that you have added around 10,000 retail touch points over the last 1 year or so and despite that we have seen a volume decline. Now given that this is an essential category and replacement cycle of the Hawai would be two times a year roughly. So, what explains the volume decline? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: The volume decline is mainly due to price reason, and GST impact. So, we definitely added new touch points but ultimately there is an overall pressure from the demand, so this is the reason for volume decrease. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Deven Kulkarni 
Text: Is there any channel destocking because of the price hikes? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Channel what you said? Channel destocking? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Deven Kulkarni 
Text: Yeah. I mean reduction of inventory in the channel because the prices have gone up by 20%- 30%. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes. The distributors and retailers are very cautious because of so many changes in MRPs. So, they're keeping less stocks. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.988)

Speaker: Deven Kulkarni 
Text: Will it be possible to quantify what will be the reduction in inventory in the channel in terms of volume terms. roughly? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.959)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We don't have it. Distributor inventory and the system and the retail level just not possible. We don’t have. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.951)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Our next question comes from the line of Girish Pai with Nirmal Bang. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: You had an 8% decline in volume in FY22 versus FY21. Did the market also decline at the same rate and if not, who gained the market share? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Over all category of Hawai and EVA, it is actually gone down because this year the market has opened up and outdoor people have started to be in the market. So, closed footwear is doing good and chappals and these things have gone down and at the same time because of high inflation, buying power of these masses has gone down. So, they're trying to hold on to their old slipper also and so delaying their purchase. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: No, I was trying to understand whether we've lost market share to any competitor, unlisted competitor, maybe somebody who's come from the South for instance? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.993)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, that's not there. Sushil Batra : You see, last year because it was an abnormal, exceptional year open footwear sale was much higher than the normal. That's why you are seeing there is a de-growth in the number. That is the only reason because last year we sold more open footwear, this year demand was less comparatively, and closed footwear picked up in this year. We don't see there is some shift in market share from here to there. It’s an overall number has come down due to open footwear and closed footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: If you got to 3 years back, this segment was 25%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: What was a mix of open to closed footwear in FY22 compared to FY21? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.562)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: This year it is around 20-80. 20% in closed footwear, 80% in open footwear and last time it was 15-85. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: Did you see any difference between urban versus rural demand? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes. Rural we are feeling more pinch, there's more pressure in the rural side of India. Urban still there is a movement but in rural India they are not able to absorb the inflation or price hikes. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: Lastly there was a mention that you will start doing better starting from Quarter 2. What exactly do you mean by that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: As we have increased prices in December and still there are three to four MRPs lying with the retailers and they are liquidating that. We are hopeful that whatever prices we have taken that will be absorbed and all the old inventories will be out of the system. There's a lot of confusion with retailers having multiple MRPs with him. We are thinking that once they liquidates their stock and the new rates will be adjusted. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: My last question is on ad spend. What was that a specific to sales in FY22 versus FY21? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: FY21 being a tough year, the spent was less intentionely, it was a less but definitely this year we spent as we have been doing around 4%. This is the gap between FY21 and FY22. FY‘22 was a normal year, FY21 was a little different year.

Text: Our next question comes from the line of Ankit Kedia with Phillip Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Do we sell to B2B players like Udaan and Ajio Business and what would be our contribution from them? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We started with Udaan and Ajio, but our contribution is quite less. It is less than 1% you can say that. So, it's a new channel for us. The problem with them is that they are playing a discounting game which we do not want to disrupt the market. We are cautiously watching them and going forward then we'll see how we have to do business. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.978)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Because one of your competitors’ books double-digit revenues through these channels in the sports category. So, do we sell directly to them or we'll sell them through a distributor channel? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.948)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Through our distributor. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: My second question was while you did say South is only 13% and we added more MBOs to West and South. Could you share that the maximum volume decline would have come more in the North market or it was evenly spread North-South-East-West? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: No, it was more in North and East part of India, West and South did well. One more reason being West, and South was affected more because of COVID lockdown which they bounced back very well last year. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: In these two geographies, 2-years down the line do you think both these geographies together can contribute around 40%-45% of our revenues in 2-years’ time or they will still remain in that 30% kind of a ballpark range? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It’s very difficult to say right now how they will grow exactly to 45% or remain that 30%-35%. So, but definitely they have a more growth rate.

Text: Our next question comes from the line of Vikas with Equirus. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vikas 
Text: My first question on the raw materials side. Can you quantify what has been the jump in the raw material prices for the quarter versus 3Q and versus 4Q of last year? Any number to attach to it? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Different material have different prices; we can tell you as an average. Average of different kinds of material, inflation or you want to know specific raw material wise? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vikas 
Text: Whether we talk about a major part of the raw material number so an average? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: You want Q4 versus Q4 or full year versus full year? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Vikas 
Text: Q4 versus Q3 and Q4 versus 4Q of last year? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.668)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Q4 versus Q4 there is huge jump definitely last year it was a very good year from raw material point of view. You can say in some material it was around 80% which is also a major contributor in the material side. So, Q4 versus Q4 overall there is a huge jump you can say around 50%- 60% but Q3 versus Q4 was less because material had already peaked out. Gap is comparatively much lower maybe around 20% in Q3 versus Q4 in overall. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vikas 
Text: Another question similar to it, there are two parts; first the GST hike that has too passed on and second is the RM inflation that has too passed on in the price hikes that we have taken? So can we say that the GST pass on is almost done and it is only the raw material price hike that has to be taken or even the GST part is also left to be reflected in the price that we have to take? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: GST has been done now. That is now history. By and large it has been settled in the market. It’s really taking time but yes it has been settled now. So raw material is only left-over item and overall inflation is everywhere on all fronts in the system; Ramesh Kumar Dua : There are two things. One thing is cost of input has gone up because of raw material itself and GST also. Other hand the buying power of the consumer has gone down. Both things have affected actually. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.98)

Speaker: Vikas 
Text: Your view as to how the market or probably our competition is strategizing with respect to the taking the price hike? Are they taking more of the price hike or they are cutting back on taking the price hike just to ensure that the demand does not get hit by this time? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Raw material is quite common for all of them. They have also taken price hike and all of them are also feeling the heat. There's a limit to pass on the price to the end consumer. For now it is wait and watch. Let us see how prices go in next quarter.

Text: Our next question comes from the line of Tejas Shah with Spark Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Couple of follow-ups. In most categories we are competing with unorganized and across categories in our channel checks we are picking up that wherever unorganized are dependent on Chinese imports, they have been struggling both on inflation and also availability count because their supply chain has been disrupted badly. Are we seeing any benefit of that in our favor because our supply chain will be relatively much more robust than unorganized competition in the three segments that we operate in? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.936)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, the materials that we're using in our Hawai slippers or Flite, EVA, we are always keeping good inventory in the system. There's no disruption in our manufacturing. We have been cautious, and we have to be cautious on that. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.521)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Yes, precisely that is the point. Definitely we are actually better off than some of the unorganized players. So, are we seeing that natural gain happening in market share because unorganized is not as competitive compared to let's say they were 2 years back or 1 year back? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The material like polymers, EVA, PU, PVC, and all-natural rubber, they are available in domestic also. So that's not an issue for them. Material is available. Now it is the question of prices. A year back, the prices were very high in local market, but now there is comfortable pricing. So we are very clear and not very concerned for these categories. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.543)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: If I see our volume, we are actually lower than FY20 volume. Understandably our capacity utilization will be lower than what we had in FY20 because we had CAPEX also in the last 2 years. Again, we have guided for Rs. 100 crores of CAPEX this year. This looks a bit higher on maintenance CAPEX side. Just wanted to understand what does this outlay for. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: No, because every year it’s a very fast-moving article and we have to create new designs. Lot of money goes in the mould side, around Rs. 25-30 crores, it’s a recurring CAPEX every year we have to do. Then we are setting up some back-end operation that is almost in the final stage. So, few expenses definitely will go there. These are the two major and other routine expenditure around IT that is around Rs. 8-10 crores. So Rs. 100 crores almost in this year, it’s always there.

Text: Our next question comes from the line of Mrs. Trivedi with Trident Capital. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mrs. Trivedi 
Text: Ramesh ji, my question is to you. It seems we are in a rather difficult situation whereas you mentioned in some ways the volume or the top line is not in our hands because the consumer is stressed because of inflation and the margin is also not in our hands because the raw material has a lot of pricing concern. Under these kinds of scenarios, how do you manage the business? What are the numbers and metrics that you focus on these days? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.924)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We are going to increase our A&SP spend plus we are going to have a competitive range introduced soon so that we are able to get the top line fixed first. So that is the priority number one. There will be some measures in appointment of new distributor, adding more outlets. So, definitely I think we will be coming back with the numbers. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mrs. Trivedi 
Text: As the situation is unfolding, there are so many different scenarios that are possible, and which is the scenario that you would be most worried about? And I'm thinking for example, if there is protracted inflation increase for the next let's say 18 months-24 months then I would imagine that there will be a lot of pain in the system. But I'm curious to hear from your experience what is it that you worry about the most in terms of future expectations? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.944)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Sometimes we have to first protect our market share and top line and we have to keep our pricing very competitive so that we are there. Once the things settle down then you can always have your better pricing and margins also. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Mrs. Trivedi 
Text: Can I ask you a follow-up on this? I think at least a couple of times during this call you have emphasized on market share. Why do you care so much about market share and why do you think if you have market shares and pricing and margin and everything else follows but I think it's very interesting your keen focus on market share? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It's very important we have the market share; we cannot lose our shelf space. We have to be there in the minds of the consumer always, that is of prime importance. Once we are always there and everything else will only then follow. If we lose our market share, then what are we left with. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mrs. Trivedi 
Text: In your experience and I'm thinking let's say in early 2010 when the inflation was 10% or 12%; if you compare that period to now, any learnings and lessons that you can apply from those times to today? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: This time inflation has been very severe. For example, the EVA material which was at Rs. 120 costing 1.5 years back if that becomes Rs. 300, it is very severe. It never happened in 2010. At that time inflation was there but it was gradual and gradually price hikes were taken, and things settled like that. This year it has been very fast. So far as we have to take four prices increases in the last 1 year, it has never happened. And still today also uncertainty continues. That’s it. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.921)

Speaker: Mrs. Trivedi 
Text: But in these times while it is bad for the economy and unfortunate for the consumer but in some ways, is this not a good time for Relaxo to really feel and take market share from unorganized players for whom the pain will be much more? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, pain is for all. They are in the system; they will always remain in the system. We all generally co-exist. Share can go down here and there that's it but doesn’t mean somebody will be wiped out in the system. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mrs. Trivedi 
Text: You feel more competition from unorganized players given your price points or from all of these organized players particularly the ones who are now going public as well and face pressures from their investors to show good results? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Competition is from unorganized also and organized also but we have to always remain competitive on all fronts. We can't just look down upon anybody lightly. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: They were selling before, now also. So listing and non-listing does not make any difference

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Thank you, Sumant. Good afternoon to everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the Q2 FY 2022. We have already shared our earnings press release and results presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q2 FY 2022 financial performance, followed by H1 FY 2022 financial performance. In Q2 FY 2022, Relaxo booked operating revenue of Rs. 714 crores as compared to Rs. 576 crores which is a growth of 24% year-on-year. EBITDA during the quarter stood at Rs. 117 crores as compared to Rs. 127 crores during the corresponding period of previous year. EBITDA decreased mainly due to steep increase in raw material prices, enhancement of marketing, brand promotion and other administrative expenses as compared to corresponding period of last year wherein raw material prices were extremely low. Other Income stood at Rs. 7 crores as compared to Rs. 5 crores in the corresponding period in the previous year. The increase is mainly due to higher interest income on investment during the quarter. Our profit after tax was Rs. 69 crores for the quarter as compared to Rs. 75 crores during the corresponding period of previous year. For the first half of FY 2022 we registered revenue of Rs. 1,212 crores as compared to Rs. 939 crores in the corresponding period in the previous year. EBITDA was at Rs. 183 crores as compared to Rs. 184 crores in the corresponding period of the previous year. Our profit after tax was Rs. 100 crores for the first half of FY 2022 as compared to Rs. 99 crores during the corresponding period of the previous year. At the end of September 30", 2021, we have 400 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 6% to our Hl FY 2022 revenues. Exports are also picking up with opening of market and contributing more than 3.5% of revenue in H1 FY 2022. Going forward we are cautious about the inflationary trend in the raw material prices which has further intensified and has reached elevated levels impacting gross margins. However, we are taking all possible measures to mitigate its impact on margins including timely price increase. We will continue our effort to grow our presence in untapped and under penetrated market and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: My first question pertains to the slide that you have shared in your presentation, the data on realization increase YoY. It has been a very sharp increase and despite that we have seen a margin pressure in the quarter. So, first of all, how should we think about this price increase and consumer reaction to that. And how should we think about margins based on this price increase going forward? Ramesh Kumar Dua : The way things are, raw material prices are still on the increase. They are yet to stabilize. All that was hoped that in the third quarter things will stabilize. But now still things are volatile, and we are keeping a watch on it on day-day-basis and accordingly we are revising our prices. But at the same time, naturally when there is unprecedented increase, there is always a consumer resistance. So, we are cautious while increasing our prices. So, we have been able to absorb part of the raw material increase in cost. But we have to also be mindful of the competition and take steps appropriately accordingly. We are taking our price increases accordingly from time to time. Already, twice we have increased the price in the past, and third is also being planned and we will keep on acting the way things are turning out to be. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: How much price increase have we taken so far in the year? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Around 15%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: This is weighted average across portfolio. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: And you spoke about inflation still being high, so have we taken again after reporting this quarter number, have taken in October-November so far? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: In October yes, we have taken some price increase. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.879)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: And are the price increases taken so far protect our margin at current level or we need to take further interventions to bring back to 2-3 years levels? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Because raw material prices have not stabilized so far. So, we will have to always keep a note of it and also, we have to keep a note of the market situation. So, on that will keep on taking appropriate actions. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.77)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Second question pertains to how demand is reacting to these price increases and what’s your read on the demand scenario because we are getting very divergent views on rural demand and non-urban demand as well. So, just wanted to check your sense on what's your read on the demand environment? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Well, for the time being demand is being affected because people don't want to keep stock of those things. They just want to reduce their inventory in the pipeline because there have been two price increases. Third also we have taken. So, even in the market there are 2-3 MRPs floating in the market. So, inventory in the pipeline is reducing. So, for the time being there is some effect on the demand that we are witnessing. And in the coming times when the price and stock will reduce then our demand will also improve 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Last one bookkeeping question, what percentage of our turnover comes from below Rs, 1000 MRP as on last year or as on half year this year? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Around 90%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: So, how do you see GST changes which have been made and how do you see that impacting demand going forward? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Well, it is for everybody. It is not for our company. So, whatever GST government is proposing, accordingly we will take appropriate action on that. For a short term we may find some consumer resistance, but after all it is for everybody.

Text: The next question from the line of Gaurav Jogani from Axis Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: My first question is with regards to the demand for the open footwear. Last year we have seen a lot of strong demand for your open footwear especially led by the rural side. And now the things are normalizing this year and the schools, and the offices are also opening up. So, how do you see the demand pattern changing going ahead? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Demand of open footwear, there are two kinds of things. One is closed footwear, another is open. Open consists of sandals and slippers. From the demand of what we find that the people who have now started moving outdoor, those articles, whether it is sandal or it is sports shoes, they are going up. And meanwhile the demand of slippers that has gone down this year. Because last year everybody was indoors, so these articles were selling more. So, that is the change we are witnessing this year. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: With your portfolio being tilted more towards the open footwear, do you see a resultant impact on your volumes or sales to that extent for this year at least? Ramesh Kumar Dua t: Because slippers numbers will definitely be less than what the demand was earlier. And the shoe division is growing more so that will have some effect. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.991)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: The next question is with regards to your margin last year had seen very sharp expansion. It was even higher above the historical average. But what sort of stable margins as a company do you envisage? I understand that they are two extremes, last year the margins expanded very high and this year it's been impacted due to RM inflation. But what kind of stable margins going ahead do you expect for the company? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Last year raw material prices were very benign and this year it is unprecedented increase. So, that is definitely telling upon our margins. Last year it was unusually high, but this year around 17% should be all right this year. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: So, going ahead 17% margins should be a steady margins what we can target? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Management 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: And with regards to, you have been telling in the opening remarks that the focus is on increasing the presence in the untapped markets. So, any light that you can throw, which all markets have you expanded to and how has the mix changed for you over the last 1.5-2 years in the product- wise segment also? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.987)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: What we have seen is that now south market started performing because the south was the only market which opened up last. So, Kerala being locked down for | year and three months, now it has opened up. So, we are seeing demand recovery coming from south market more. And e- commerce is also doing pretty well. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: What will be the contribution for e-commerce now for your overall space? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We are doing 10% e-commerce. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: In terms of the margin profile, is e-commerce a lower margin channel vis-a-vis your regular MBO channel to that extent, given there are returns and there is also the e-com player margins also there. So, how do the margin differ between the channels? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.802)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We try to keep it same margin across all the channels, be it e-commerce, modern trade or wholesale. Because otherwise the goods will flow from one category to another category, so we try to keep the same margin.

Speaker: Neerav Rajiv 
Text: This is just more from a longer-term perspective regarding the kid’s footwear segment. I just wanted to know your views regarding the long-term prospects of the branded segment of the kids' footwear. I have just read certain reports which indicate that the kid's footwear given that the sizes keeps changing the inclination towards branded wear is low. So, wanted to know your perspective firstly on the market and also where does Relaxo stand in this segment and also any inputs on the margin side?

Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have our articles above 1000 in our Sparx brand and that is what we are doing, and we have other categories also whether it is Bahamas. In every category we have premium articles based on the price segment we are in. So, that accordingly we keep on developing premium articles in every category whether it is Flite or it is Bahamas or Sparx. In 1000+ there are shoes. That we are also taking care and focusing on that, and we will continue to do that.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: I just wanted to get a sense of how the four bands have performed for us in the first half of the year. How has Sparx, Bahamas, Flite, and the main Relaxo brand done? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: If we talk about Sparx brand it is doing pretty well because last year the demand was subdued because it is more of an outdoor category and premium category. So, people were not moving out. Now people started moving out. Sparx brand overall is doing much better than the other brands. Secondly, in Flite we have two categories, one is outdoor, and one is a home brand, which we call Flite EVA and Flite PU. So, outdoor brands across all four categories are doing much better compared to what it was last year. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: If you could also help us understand, what would be the contribution of each of these four brands to the total revenues? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Hawai segment like Bahamas in Relaxo is around 25% and rest is almost equal between Flite brand and Sparx brand. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: So, Hawai plus Bahamas is 25 and rest is equally shared. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Between Flite and Sparx, almost. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: Also, just wanted to get a sense from you that in terms of Sparx especially we are seeing a lot more advertisement which is focused on being fit, being outdoors, but a lot more shoe type advertisements. So, just wanted to get a sense from you, is that something that is going to be the next focus for the company in terms of looking at more from a good sport shoe rather than a more sandal kind of a thing which it was earlier? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It's mixed actually. These four segments are doing pretty well. Like there's a trend of Athleisure. So, there is a good trend, so sandals are doing pretty well in south India. People don't prefer too much of a covered shoe over there. So, it depends upon market also. Shoes is more for north and West and sandal is more for south India. We can see growth both sides. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: Sparx, what would be the mix between shoe and sandal? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Sandal is 60%, 40% is shoes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: My last question was more on the unorganized / the imports which come in from China. Have you seen any disruption in them and is that also some contribution that we can expect for growth going ahead for us? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: I think the freight cost importing from China has gone up significantly. So, last one and a half years, the supply has subdued from China that is an advantage for us.

Text: The next question is from the line of Akhil Parekh from Elara Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: First question on the price hikes that we have taken and the inflationary environment that we are talking about. In past concalls we had mentioned that there was a shift from unorganized to organized in this COVID times. Do we continue to see this trend that the inflationary scenario is extremely strong at this particular time? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.991)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are having good market share, but in an unorganized market to capture the data and try to find out. It is very difficult. As far as we are concerned, we can only focus around what we are doing, how we are doing in different markets. Because share of that is totally not captured anywhere. It’s very difficult to comment on that. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.989)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: We have been hearing that some of the organized players also have been struggling over the last 8-10 months. Would it be fair to assume that we have at least gained market share from the weaker organized players? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Our market share is improving, but to what extent, it is replacing unorganized, it is very difficult to comment. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: But it is better than a year or two years back. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: You can say that. But you can’t calculate because things are not available in an open domain. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Second question is on the capacity front. In the presentation, we have mentioned at 7.5 lakh footwear pairs per day, and we have recently commissioned our Bhiwadi Rajasthan capacity which is at 1.5 lakh pairs, and it can make 10 lakh pairs per day. Currently with 9 lakh pairs per day, is that correct? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: At present we have declared that the capacity is 10 lakhs in the board meeting it was approved from October it is 10 lakhs, earlier it was 7.5 lakhs.

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: My first question is with respect to our presence in the southern part of India. Can you highlight as to what are the steps that you are taking with respect to expansion of our revenues from south India mainly focusing on either distribution expansion or retail outlets addition? What has been the pace over last one year or what was the pace when you were back and what is the current status as of now and what are the growth plans mainly to grow in the southern region? I will come up with the second question after this. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: In South India there was lot of lockdown. The lockdown was extended maximum in Southern markets especially Kerala. So, now they have started opening up and we are a getting a demand recovery. It's just recovery happening from South India. Once the recovery is done, then we will start growing. Some markets we have already started taking steps and appointing distributor like Tamil Nadu. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: If you could just give a ballpark figure as to what were the revenues in the South probably one year or before the COVID time and from a normalized run rate what would be the revenues at this quarter or two, any rough amount? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Two years back it was 10% fell down to 7%-8%, now we are back to 10%. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: And with respect to the distribution addition, how has been the pace? What was it pre-COVID and what is the current status? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We just started distributor expansion in the last three months. It's very early to say anything about that. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vikas Jain 
Text: Last question from my side, as you mentioned in your opening remarks, the raw material inflation is incrementally hurting us. So, any guidance that you would want to give for the next one or two quarters, or what would be gross margin figure that we can come up with in H2? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Because raw material price have not stabilized. So, margins will continue to remain at a pressure. So, we are cautious of it and keeping a tab on the market conditions and accordingly taking our steps.

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: Firstly, I wanted to understand the mix of open and closed footwear in the first half of this year. IfI recall last year, it was 85:15 and the year prior to that FY20 it was 80:20. What was it in 1H FY22?

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: The other thing I wanted to ask you is over the years, I have looked at your presentations and every time I see that 50,000 MBO being the standard number that I see in your presentation in terms of your penetration and distribution. So, have you not increased your penetration beyond the 50,000 number because I have seen your presentation 6 years back. It is still a50,000 number. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.991)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Because of last one a half year, we are still able to maintain that because there are a lot of outlets getting closed down. This COVID has created a havoc. We are just maintaining it. Once this raw material prices, COVID outbreak, GST, all these things get settled then we will be able to give you the exact picture, how fast we are improving. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: But even pre COVID I have seen for many years the number has remained constant about 50,000, any which way. My next question... 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Because the outlets are same, but our presence have improved, like suppose an outlet used to keep 3 brands now that they are keeping 4 brands, so the depth has improved. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: You made a claim that you increased market share. When I look at the volumes, it is down YoY. So, is that the market is down far more than you have done. When I look at the volumes that you have sold in Q2 this year versus the volumes in the year before that they are down YoY. Is it that the market volumes are down much more than you? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we can’t say that. The demand of closed footwear this year has increased. Overall demand of open footwear has gone down because people are now moving out. So that is the reason that's all. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.988)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: Just last question regarding competitive intensity. There are a couple of IPOs on the cards, Campus and Metro. Are you seeing any increased competitive intensity or competitive moves from either of these players at least from the campus’s side that you are seeing in the market which is probably not letting you increase prices more than what you could otherwise tried to do? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: This matter is totally different. We have nothing to do. Campus has only one category, sports shoes. But we have our own space. Market is big. They have their own space, there is nothing of any alarm or concern. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: So, when you talk about, you have to watch the market when you take price hikes, who were you referring to specifically? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

If you just could help us understand from the product launch in terms of the conception to manufacturing, what colors and sizes would you generally push to manufacture? And also, the distribution, in which cities would you push more sizes and different colors and the end product life cycle, once the demand tapers off? So, if you could please help us understand what is the product life cycle for your various brands?

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It varies category to category. Sparx takes more time compared to basic hawai. So, we cannot give generalized figure, but Sparx takes maximum time. You can say around 7 to 8 months compared to a basic Hawai which takes 2 to 3 months. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Divyata 
Text: How do you determine into which colors or which sizes you want to push in which of the geographies, like in which of the regions?

Text: We get data from the marketing department which state or which region, what preferences they have, which color, what sizes, the size of the feet, so all the data we have. Accordingly, we take the decision. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Divyata 
Text: Have you extended your technology data. I was going through your past annual reports and there is mention of various IT technologies which you have deployed to understand the market behavior. So, have you extended to your retail stores also where you get a sense of what is the fast-moving product or what is the slow-moving product? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We do have SFA, which lies with the sales officers, and we have DMS which is a software based, and it is at distributor point. So, we get data from there only, what sizes are selling, what SQs are doing well, which market is performing how, so these are two technology pieces what we use.

Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: The market is quite too huge, so we have equal presence if you talk about in western market as compared to VKC. So, they have some strong states of their own. We do also have our strong states.

Speaker: Divyata 
Text: The new facility addition that we have taken about, so that will be for any particular brand or particular open or closed footwear or it will be across, like the additional 1.5 lakhs pair per day. Which product will be manufactured there?

Speaker: Divyata 
Text: And the idea of increasing the capacity on the western side is basically to cater to some newer markets in which we are not already present? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It is overall. We have to overall increase our penetration, whether it is south whether it is west or even some unrepresented part of North and East also. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Divyata 
Text: Lastly, you did mention that the demand has not yet picked up. So, in H2 what you see some wrapping up of demand especially of the closed footwear? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Now market has opened. By and large in all parts of India and things are opening up. But as I told, there is lot of resistance because of price increases that are happening. The raw materials are going up almost month after month. So, there is resistance from consumers, from retailers and they are liquidating the stocks which are in the pipeline. So that is it. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.952)

Text: The next question is from the line of Yusuf Inamdar from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited, please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Yusuf Inamdar 
Text: I have only one question from a long-term perspective. If I look at the competitors, the average selling price of two of the largest footwear companies is in the range of 500 to 600 whereas ours is in the range of Rs 125 to Rs 150. Can you just tell me, since we are beginning to focus more on closed footwears and high-end products, can you just give me an idea, a ballpark number, what could it be our ASP in the next 3 to 4 years? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It will increase but it will increase at regular pace in a sustained manner but don't expect it to increase substantially because you should appreciate, we are serving masses and 85% business is for masses. Only 15% are others. So, the ratio will remain what it is. It will have some effect, some improvement, that's all. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Yusuf Inamdar 
Text: One more thing with respect to the number of exclusive brand outlets, which we have around 400. Is it safe to assume that gradually we will be increasing our EBOs? So, is it safe to assume that slowly we are moving towards more of a retail model compared to the distribution model which we had earlier? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.89)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. Presently we are focusing more on multi brand and this 400 is kind of our display cum sale model where strategically we understand the consumer behavior and understand what is the consumer psyche. Our business contribution from our retail is just 6%. So, we will continue accordingly.

Text: The next question from the line of Gaurav Jogani from Axis Capital, please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: My first question is with regards, what are the key learnings from the COVID times? A lot of the retailers we have seen have cut down on cost and have done purchase improvements during this COVID times. So, if you can highlight 2 or 3 key initiatives that we have taken during COVID times and that can help in cost savings going ahead as well. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Cost saving is an ongoing process. We have to always keep the company competitive, efficient and that is going on. Even in this difficult times the fact that we are improving our efficiencies and that we will continue to do it. Last year we had some cut in marketing and administration expenses but this year we have started these expenses and the brand-building again, we can’t keep it always on the low. But as far as manufacturing expenses are concerned, that effort is on. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Any numbers that you like to highlight, like some percentage of cost that you are permanently able to save now going ahead, say like 10 crores, 15 crores that will be permanently taken a saving going ahead as well. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.966)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: This is the only in the marketing and administration last year, we took a cut. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.5)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: In permanent nature I think a don't see much possibility, but I think consulting that's what we can say, that is the only item which we cut last year, and we are not reinstating. In manufacturing even if we can hold our conversion costs, that is a great achievement. That's what we are trying to hold on to. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: One related question to this, a lot of players are we now talking about the substituting the raw materials with alternative materials which are cheaper and also better quality. So, any kind of process re-engineering also that we have worked down that you would like to highlight in terms of the raw material side? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.99)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to be mindful that we maintain quality first and the other things afterwards. There is very little possibility of doing little bit of juggling of the polymers. But beyond that people will only sacrifice the quality. So, we are mindful of it. Accordingly, we are taking the cautious moves. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: One last bit from my end is, over the years if we take a trend from FY13 to even FY2021, we have seen that the EBITDA margin expansion is largely led by gross margin. So, our gross margins has expanded from 53.5% in 2013 to around 59.5% in FY21. What further scope do we see of expansion in the gross margin, or do we think this is a peak level at this point in time? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Gross margin, definitely there has been improvement year after year. But this year being a different year, raw materials prices are touching new high and we took some price increase also, it's really tough how much margin we can expand. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Not in short term, I am talking about the next 3-4 years, maybe what kind of our gross margin that you can target going ahead, barring these volatile times. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Long term definitely we have been adding new product every time. I think 40% churning is in our case. So, we add more premium product in each category. Definitely there is always a scope to improve the gross margin and we can see the same trend in coming years long-term. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Text: The next question is from the line of Ankit Kedia from Phillip Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: You mentioned the e-commerce contribution today has become 10%, with things opening up and the contributions remaining same at double-digit, how much of this is coming from closed footwear and Sparx and how much is it from open footwear? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.98)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Majority is from Sparx footwear which is around 85% to 90% and rest is from Bahamas and open footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Would the ASP difference, in one of the questions you mentioned that we are not doing price differential, so would the inventory online be similar and fresh inventory, or we are liquidating inventory online? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Majority of it is the running articles, and very few maybe you could say less than 10% is the obsolete inventory which we are pushing. So majority is the regular articles. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: My second and last question would be again on your EBOs, how many of these are owned EBOs currently and over the next few years, what is the plan to expand our EBO count in South market as well? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: For the time being there is no plan for any EBO in South. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: How many of the EBOs are owned versus franchisees currently? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra

Text: The next question is from the line of Ashish Kanodia from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: On gross margin, on the inventory my understanding is that, had there been no inventory built up then the impact on gross margin would been even higher during this quarter, is my understanding correct? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: You are right. Definitely the increase in inventory definitely impact the gross margin as far as calculation is concerned. But otherwise, margins have been improving except this 1-1.5 years and especially these two quarters due to raw material prices. If you just exclude that part, even then there is improvement in gross margin. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Secondly, what is your internal thought process in terms of at current RM prices, what is the comfortable gross margin where the company would like to operate at and to reach that kind of a gross margin what is the kind of price hike we will need to take further? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Prices of raw materials are still on the rise. Things have not stabilized, and we have to keep on watching from time to time rather month to month and we have to then see what is the consumer sentiment, market sentiment and pass on the price increase. So, since things have not stabilized, we cannot comment on that, how the things are going to turn out in the coming months. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.982)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: I think there was a discussion that retailers and the distributers might be liquidating inventory because of COVID, so is there a difference between the primary sales and secondary sales? What I mean to say is when I look at the growth reported by Relaxo and if we have to compare that with the actual growth which a retailer or the distributer might have reported, with that growth be higher and then if that is the case, so as the retailers and the distributers starts to rebuild the inventory then that will ultimately benefit you in subsequent quarters, is it the right way to look at it? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.981)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to see. Once things stabilized, the markets inventory also, we are cautious at the moment. Once things come to normalcy, then only we will know how things turn out to be. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.945)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Last question in term of price hikes, the RM prices has been higher, has there been any challenges with the supply as well or is the supply is at least uninterrupted? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.992)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Are you talking about supply of raw material? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: For some of the raw materials even the supply has been an issue like ethyl vinyl acetate, but it doesn't mean that we have any obstruction in production, but things have been a little difficult. That is why there is inflation trend whenever there is shortage of a material, then only inflation trend become much more adverse. In EBO, particularly when the supply has been also restricted that is added to the problem.

Text: The next question is from the line of Girish Pai from Nirmal Bang. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: During the course of your commentary, you mentioned that there are 2 or 3 different MRPs in the market, is this a unique position that you are in as we speak today compared to the last 10 years and how is this impacting your sales or how is the distributors response to this? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: You are right at the moment because there have been two frequent increases. But there are so many articles, every article in retail they never come to zero stock, then only you will buy the new article. Because some of the sizes they become short of the inventory, so he has to buy a new. That is why there's a mix-up of different MRPs in the market so it will take some time before things get set right. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: Is that responsible for your slower volume growth this quarter? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: After all we told you that people are liquidating, they are maintaining their system. Whenever there is a price revision, people want to be little cautious in mind, that we are noticing. As the inventory supply chain is getting reduced, distributor sales are better. So, he is also trying to be cautious. Everybody wants to have minimum inventory. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: A more strategic question pre-pandemic when I look at your ASP and volume growth statistics across, say 3-4-5 years before the pandemic, your ASPs have not grown very much. It's been basically volume growth led. Is that your strategic thought process? Beyond the pandemic is that how you want to grow? You want to kind of drive volumes and not focus too much on ASP? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.743)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are not focusing on ASP. We are focusing on what category consumer needs, whatever categories trade is requiring, we are offering that to trade. Our focus is on building the categories, whether it is Bahamas brand, whether it is Flite(~PU or EVA) or Sparx. So historically also 85% has been slippers business for the company and that always gets traction accordingly in the market. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: Last question your cashflow from operations seems to be quite bad. At least when I compare for 1H versus the full year numbers, anything that will change in the second half for the cashflow from operations number to look better than what it was at the end of September 2021? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.988)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Cashflow is bad from a number point of view yes, I agree but if you see the number, there is an increase in inventory, that is the main reason for that. And due to inflation, the inventory which we were carrying, so I think 20% is coming from the inflation and rest is the overall increase. So, these are the reasons being in a special situation. But in coming times, definitely it will be back to normal and there will be comfortable cash from operations.

Speaker: Mythili Balakrishnan 
Text: This is a question which comes possibly at a tangent but currently we are in an environment where raw materials prices are going up but at some point, that will turn around and it will start going down. In that time do we start reducing prices or do we just reduce prices on new SKUs and how do we think about pricing in that kind of a scenario? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.912)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to wait and see how the things stabilize. We have to see how the market situation is at that time. We have to be mindful of one thing we have to be reasonable with the consumer and that is what we have done always.

Text: The next question is from the line of Jignesh Kamani from GMO. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jignesh Kamani 
Text: We have a very high inventory and as you said since raw materials cost is increasing every month so because of high inventory probably at a low cost or the current cost will be less favorable compared to a competitor? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Inventory in the raw material, that is always favorable when there is a rising price. But as far as our finished goods are concern, we have inventory because there was no demand in open footwear segment but in the coming time things will improve on both fronts. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jignesh Kamani 
Text: So, if there is a price hike, we will get the benefit of that also on the upcoming, right? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.794)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: There is always a time delay in getting the things because we have to watch coming months also and trend also and then you have to take appropriate action. If there is an unprecedented price increase, the entire price increase we have not been able to pass because polymer going up is 100% is something beyond imagination. Keeping everything in view, we take appropriate action. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.966)

Speaker: Jignesh Kamani 
Text: Secondly whenever there is a price hike or expected price hike generally dealers or distributor tries to increase their stock so that they can get benefit of a lower price products. Are we not witnessing that scenario as of now? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.929)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Actually, when we revise our price, we revise the price for MRP also, ultimately the margin remains the same. Rather he is more cautious let his inventory be lower so that when the new price comes, he is able to pass on accordingly. Otherwise, if he has an old MRP he has to push that article first. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Jignesh Kamani 
Text: But in the old MRP, probably the discount offering to customer will be much lower compared to anew MRP. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.984)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: That could be at a retail level, I don't know what kind of discounts they do. When they have two prices prevailing, then definitely they get some advantage also. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

We will begin with a brief discussion from the management's end, and then we can open up the floor for the Q&A. Over to you, sir. Thank you.

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Good afternoon to everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the financial year 2020-2021. We have already shared our earnings press release and results presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with Q4 FY 2021 financial performance, followed by full year FY 2021 Financial Performance. In Q4 FY 2021, Relaxo booked operating revenue of Rs. 748 crores, which is a growth of 38% year-on-year. The strong revenue growth was partially due to low base of Q4 FY 2020, as we know sales was impacted in Q4 of last year due to lockdown in the month of March last year. EBITDA during the quarter was Rs. 163 crores which was a strong growth of 69% as compared to the corresponding period of previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 21.8% vis- à-vis EBITDA margin of 17.8% in Q4 FY 2020. Our profit after tax was Rs. 102 crores for the quarter, up by 97% year-on-year with a PAT margin of 13.7%. For FY 2021, our revenue declined marginally by 2% to Rs. 2,359 crores with EBITDA margin of 21%. Our PAT of Rs. 292 crores in FY 2021, with a margin of 12.4% grew by 29% year-on-year, mainly due to product mix and saving in selling and administrative expenses. During FY 2021, we generated a cash of Rs. 513 crores from operations and spent Rs. 142 crores in CAPEX and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of March 2021, we have 398 exclusive brand outlets which contribute around 7% of total revenue. Export is holding its ground and contributing around 4% of revenue. During the ongoing crisis, we are undertaking all necessary measures to ensure safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We continue to support and provide assistance to our distributor and customers. Due to lockdown in various parts of India, overall demand for footwear is subdued right now. However, we believe that demand for footwears will bounce back whenever these restrictions are lifted. The second wave of COVID-19 India is more severe and continues to impact lives and livelihood. We stand with all those affected and are dedicated toward protecting and supporting our employees, partners and communities in the face of this unfolding crisis. Relaxo, remains committed towards its stakeholder by creating a sustainable, profitable and growing business. The company enjoys comfortable liquidity position with zero net debt and continues to provide assistance to its distributors and vendors. Despite the uncertainty related to the extent and length of the fresh wave, we believe that company is well placed to emerge stronger in the post COVID- 19 world. We remain committed to give the best experience and value for money to our customer and creating long-term value for our shareholders. We can now open the floor for question. Thank you very much.

Text: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Nihal Jham from Edelweiss. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: Sir, a couple of questions from my side. And I am taking from our last interaction, at that point in time, obviously, you mentioned that given the trend in raw material prices, you expected longer term margins to sustain at around 18%. But we have obviously ended the year at a much higher number. First, if you could comment, what is it that you expect going forward? Then after which I can come to my next question. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: This year, that is 2021, the margins have been more because we have been saving on account of sales and promotion expenses, travel expenses and some professional expenses and the raw material price also have been benign. Some efficiencies we worked at back end in our plants, that was the main reason for achievement of more than expected EBITDA level. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: So, as a trend, is that in the coming year we expect most of these expenses would normalize, especially on the advertising part? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to see it from time to time how things are. Presently the way second wave has come up, traveling will remain restricted. But brand building is something you can't avoid, that we have to go on. So, this year our strategy is that we have to build our brand in the long-term interest. So, this year, compared to last year, our expenditure on brand building will be more, this is what I want to say. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.971)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Sorry, sir, we are not able to hear you. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The expenditure on brand building this year will be more than it was last year, because for longer periods we cannot keep on saving on brand expenditure like advertisements. So, this year, as a strategy, we will be spending more money on brand building. That is what I wanted to say. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: That's very clear, sir. Thank you so much. One more question from my side. I just wanted to understand on the industry scenario at present. Will it be fair to say that given the disruption that has happened because of COVID, especially in a lot of our MBO channels there has been disruption of other brands which has helped us increase market share, would that be a right sense of what is happening on ground at this point in time? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.975)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The way things are very chaotic, unpredictable environment is prevailing. and nobody expected second COVID wave will be like that, we are now in the lockdown. And when the lockdown starts opening up, only then things will start working. Presently, three out of our eight plants are operating, and maybe 10% - 15% markets are open. So, business is largely affected. So, the way things open up, then we will be able to know how the things take shape. But as far as unorganized/organized is concerned, definitely we are in a better situation than unorganized players, that advantage we might have than others. And as far as our retail outlets are concerned, there our business is hardly 7% - 8%. So, last year also we suffered, a lot of retail outlets were closed. But because we are selling to a lot of multi- brand outlets around 50,000, which are through wholesalers and distributors . So that is our saving grace that we are able to have in our business. That is the way the things are. That advantage we will have this year also. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: Sure. Just a last question, what will be the share of ecommerce for the entire year? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Ecommerce, including modern trade is hardly 10%, I would say 8% rather. Some states are very low, after all we are selling not very high value item. Last year the ecommerce was closed for a lot of time, so shoes and all other, sale was less. Ultimately, our business was a little bit affected on ecommerce. But it is not a very big stake for us in ecommerce. Our articles are more on multi- brand outlets. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.988)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: Absolutely. I was just trying to understand that this year, given the disruption, if there is a sizable increase in our share compared to last year, especially on the ecommerce side. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, you can't say that, because ultimately our articles are mostly priced around Rs. 125 to Rs. 150 - Rs. 200, these articles are unviable to be sold online. We generally sell to multi-brand outlets only. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: Absolutely. Because in the second quarter, when the disruption was at its peak, we had reached a 10% share, so I just wanted to check maybe there is a continuation of that once the open up happened after, say, September or October. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: You know, when things open, then online business is there. But we have seen, whole year how the things have panned out, but still we are sitting in lockdown. And ultimately, this year or last year, if the markets are chaotic, what we found is that when the people are indoors, more of the slippers have sold, this year also things may remain like this, where closed footwear will remain affected, and the online sale will also remain affected.

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amnish Agarwal form Prabhudas Liladher. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Amnish Agarwal 
Text: I have a couple of questions. My first question is on the raw materials front. If you look at the gross margins, both on Y-o-Y as well as even on a Q-o-Q basis our gross margins were actually down, because in this quarter we are 56.8%, in the previous quarter they were 58.9%. So, how much is inflation in raw material currently? Because I understand that most of these petrochemical based imports have moved up even in the month of March, April and May. And secondly, how much price increase we have undertaken? And will we be able to sustain gross margins at the current levels? So, that is my question number one, first part of the margins. The second bit on the margin side, if you look last year, we have cut down on our overhead significantly. If I look at full year, they are down by nearly 400 bps, and you are yourself indicating that the ad spend will go up. Now, looking at this scenario that this year supply spend will comeback, raw materials are high, so what sort of outlook on margins would you like to get from here on? So, this is my first question on margins. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The way things are, raw material prices definitely have gone up and are volatile. And this scenario we have faced in our life, a number of times. When the rubber was 100, then it was 250, these things do happen to any business cycle, and we have gone through it. So, what is our strategy? Every quarter, whatever price are, accordingly, we will then take our decision, keeping in view the market condition, price revision is done. So, whatever is required and is possible then we pass it on to our customers. So, this is what we have been doing. Raw material, naturally will always vary. But at the same time, we have to be watchful about competitive intensity in the market. And then you can't just immediately have the kind of knee-jerk reaction to prices and then after three months you may say, okay, now price have gone down so we reduce it. So, there has to be a kind of stability, from our best judgment we pass on the price compared to industry and looking at the competitive intensity, and accordingly take the decision and next quarter again we review the things. So, this is what we have been doing since ages, and this is what we tend to do in future also; Keep on watching the prices, keep on quarterly reviewing the market conditions and accordingly passing on. When margin is concerned, naturally this year things are different, so we have to watch the market conditions and take a decision. The way things are, gross margin may get impacted. But on the overall year basis, we have to wait and see, we can't say now. Accordingly, management also does a course correction in between also. Regarding branding, actually , that is the call we have taken, but then we keep on reviewing all these things. Market is very volatile, raw material or others wise. These lockdown exercises, nobody can say with guarantee how long lockdown will continue, how long COVID wave will continue, now there is a fear of COVID third way also. The way things are, nothing can be said with certainty. We have to see, keep on reviewing every quarter and take corrective action. That's it.

Speaker: Amnish Agarwal 
Text: Sir, how much pricing we would have undertaken in the past few months? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Around 7% to 8% we have taken, but again, this price rise is depending upon article to article in the same category some article we have taken more than 10% or 15%. But again, we have to see which article can take how much price increase. Because we are in a kind of fashionable market, some articles don’t perform, some articles perform too much. And then we have to see what is the competition rate of similar articles. So, accordingly, article by article we have to review. We can't generally say, okay, 7% all around. So, we have to be very watchful on this, and have to decide article to article basis. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Amnish Agarwal 
Text: Okay. Sir, my second question is on the demand scenario. Because Relaxo caters more to the value for money segment in footwear, and last year rural India and small towns where was not impacted much by the first wave of COVID, but this time around the scenario seems to be different. So, what sort of an on the ground situation you are currently witnessing? And in your view, will it take longer for the demand to come back this time around, more so in the small towns and rural India? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Well, again, the things are, difficult to predict. But the ways things are and now COVID second wave is going down, things are improving, we think in a couple of months things will start improving and maybe back to normal. Many times, if there is a pent-up demand, immediately things start improving. I think June, July it will start, July will be the very good month to improve. Different states are taking different decisions. If the lockdown prevails and things will remain the way they are, it is a very difficult thing to predict., we will have to wait and see only; nobody can say with certainty what is going to happen. Because everybody is confused, to whom so ever we asked the question, how long things will continue the way things are, nobody can predict. You will have to wait and see.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: My first question is on the demand for closed footwear, like first few quarters of the year the demand was driven by open footwear. But the expectations were, as we move closer to the festive season and winter season, the demand will pick up. So, how has that been the case for demand in closed footwear for third quarter as well as in fourth quarter? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Demand of closed footwear did improve during festive season, the quarter three and quarter four, both. Before that, demand of closed footwear was fairly low, because it was all under a period of lockdown a few months we lost, people were also cautious in moving in the markets, people were more indoor, so shoe business was affected. But after this festival season, third quarter and fourth quarter have been quite satisfactory, as far as closed footwear is concerned. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Okay. And would it be fair to say the demand is now back to pre-COVID level for almost all the categories? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: This quarter four, yes, it was rather better. But now, again, this first quarter of this year we are sitting in lockdown, so what can be said about this time. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Sure. Just last question on the price hikes, you mentioned that on an average 7% to 8% price hike, so have we passed on the entire inflation in the raw material PU, EVA and even PVC, because the prices of raw metal have risen far more than 7%, 8% in last few quarters. So, should we expect more price hikes to happen during first two quarters of the year? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Well, we have to again review quarter by quarter, this is what we decided for this quarter, keeping in view the market conditions also. Now then we have to see how much raw material we have in stock. But at the same time, again, you have to look outward also and backward also, what is the supply chain; and outward, what is the market emerging competition scenario. Keeping that thing in view, we will review the things and then accordingly revise our prices, whatever whenever required, quarter by quarter.

Text: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Tejash Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejash Shah 
Text: Hope all of you are keeping well. Sir, sorry to stress this point more, but the first question pertains to our margin philosophy. And I will just give you some data before you answer the question. Sir, in last three years we have added roughly Rs. 400 crores of turnover, and we have added Rs. 200 crores of EBITDA there, Rs. 193 crores to be precise. Which roughly means that incremental turnover is actually coming at way higher EBITDA margin. And obviously, this year is abnormal, and you said that some of the costs were not there. But in a normal scenario, where would you like this business to operate at, at least for the near term? Will it be 17% range or that is not a part of the calculation at all, and it is an outcome based on the economic environment? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.62)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It is very difficult to tell you what EBITDA margin will be, because things are totally unpredictable. The way we are sitting in the lockdown, we think it is difficult. Raw materials are expensive, overhead will just mount the way things are, we are trying to control the things. But let the things settle down then only quarter-by-quarter things will improve. Things are very unpredictable at the moment, totally volatile. Nobody can predict at this moment how the year is going to end. We only hope that this wave settles down, things start opening up. Then accordingly we will take our decisions, depending upon whether a price revision is required and what expenses to be saved for this year. So, we have to then take all these precautions. Definitely, if the things were under pressure, the margin will also be under pressure . 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.926)

Speaker: Tejash Shah 
Text: Sir, let me rephrase the question. So, let us assume hypothetically and then we hope so that situation normalizes very fast. As a business, are we comfortable operating at 20% plus margin without compromising on our competitive moat or our competitive power in the very competitive landscape that in any case we are operating in? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to always watch competition also and act accordingly. Competition intensity is there, we have to keep things reasonable because of pricing, so that we don't want to lose market share. And then we have to spend money on brand building. So, all the things, keeping it together, sustaining 20% this year is going to be a real challenge, it is not possible the way things are now. But we have to wait quarter-by-quarter and see how the things open up. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Tejash Shah 
Text: Fair enough, this answers the question. The second question, you mentioned, and last time also you had mentioned, export presence in international market. So, any more firmer details on that? So, will it be anyways connected to PLI scheme that government is proposing on footwear as well? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: Let me answer the first part first. Actually, right now 4% of the company's revenue is contributed by export sales. And we are able to sustain these sales in last year also, because due to COVID all these Gulf countries and African countries have been affected a lot. But we have been able to achieve around 98% of the previous year. Since the government incentives we have been already in touch with the government authorities, whatever incentives we have been able to avail we are availing. And surely this impact of COVID is happening in this quarter as well because many countries have partial lockdowns or night curfew or complete lockdowns, so we are just having a ‘wait and watch’ and see how the things improve. But the good part is, we have been exporting in our own brand with our standard of quality which is really bringing confidence in the mind of consumer there. So, we are very confident we will come back revive the business soon, once the things settle down on COVID front.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikhil Chaudhary 
Text: Sir, I have just two questions. can you share the mix of closed footwear when we started the year and probably versus now when we end the year? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we can average out. For the year, our closed footwear share is around 15%, 85% is open footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikhil Choudhary 
Text: Okay. And it is same like when we started the year and when we are ending the year, correct? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: In the start of the year, we were in lockdown, there was no share at all. April we lost, May also some part we lost. Definitely first quarter, second quarter share was low, it’s only after festival third and fourth quarter when things started opening up, when people started moving around, then only the closed footwear started improving. So, third and fourth quarter share of closed footwear was better, it improved, it came to better than last year. But first two quarters it was affected. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.93)

Speaker: Nikhil Choudhary 
Text: Okay. And sir, when we started the year, as in what I have meant is, like when we started, before the lockdown what is the usual share like? Because Campus is also coming up with a lot of closed varieties or SKUs in the closed footwear, and what our checks suggest is that Campus has become aggressive. So, just wanted a sense on how the competitive intensity is from Campus and how we are able to tackle it. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: So, the competition is a very good thing for the company. The company always remains more active, and it is always good to have good competition, as a result the whole industry grows. And as far as your question, earlier than last year what was our share, it was 20% because first quarter and second quarter of the previous year were much better than what it was last year. So, this year because sale of slipper was much higher and growth was much more, so the ratio of open footwear went up across footwear. Because today also, throughout the year schools were closed so school shoe sale was not there, people were moving less outdoors so sale was affected, and other article also like tennis shoe, that is again closed footwear, because schools were closed so there were no sale. So, that has been one of the reasons. Even outdoor movement is less, sale of closed footwear goes down. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikhil Choudhary 
Text: Got it. Sir, all in all, we have not lost any market share, right? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, there is no loss of share. It is cyclical because of the market condition that things are happening like that. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikhil Choudhary 
Text: Got it. And sir, last thing, I just wanted to understand our strategy wherein the competitor is having nine distributors for, say, a set of area and we are just having one or two distributors, won’t it strain the balance sheet of one or two distributors in keeping all SKUs cut sizes? Just wanted a perspective, because I understand probably one or two distributors are not able to keep all the cut sizes, SKUs, and supply to our MBOs 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It is a matter of strategy. When you have too many distributors, they fight amongst themselves and then they say we don’t get margin. But if that competition will be too intensive among the distributors, then also they start losing interest in a brand. But when you give an allocated area to a distributor, then only he become more motivated to do that. And we have to protect that area suppose today you are my customer, I give you certain area, you do with your all-hard work and develop that area, and tomorrow suppose they put another distributor, so how you will feel like? After all, you have nurtured and developed the area, so it is your territory, your responsibility also. Today, if my salespeople go in the market and take orders, whom they will give order to out of the nine, if it is one I will give to that person only, the person who is responsible for that territory. So, that is the way we just operate, and we do allocation of area. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.864)

Speaker: Nikhil Choudhary 
Text: Fair from the point of view of distributor, but just wanted a sense on how retailers are perceiving it. Because what happens is, I understand, I am completely agreeing with you that the distributor will definitely want to preserve his own interest as to he should not have the competition. But retailers will have lesser choices and then probably, from the point of view of retailers then it becomes a little hard in keeping our SKUs in all cut sizes, just getting a perspective, 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: See, that I understand. When I find some distributor cannot handle all the range, then we may say, okay, you take these two brands, rest we give to another. But still, he will have some kind of a control or responsibility of that category. But from a retailer point of view, you are right, if he has more choices then he also plays between two distributors. Too much cutting of discount, then he expects too much of credit also from each other. That also is a very unhealthy position. As a company, we go to the retailer, we find what difficulties he is facing, then we sort out the way the things are. We don’t want a distributor should overcharge, and at the same time we don’t want the retailer should force him to cut too much discount and then both bleed later on. The retailers also many times pass too much discount to the consumer, that also we don’t want to see. When the retailer doesn’t turn, he looks back at the distributor, distributor looks at the company. We want there has to be some responsibility of the distributor, give him area, let him develop it. Whatever difficulty a retailer faces, then we are there to take care of it. This is the way we do things.

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Dhaval Mehta from ASK Investment Managers. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Sir, my first question is, let us say, in FY 2021 what would have been the industry decline of the footwear category? And how the competitive landscape has changed in last one year? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, if you have noticed, during last year the formal segment, outdoor segment has declined, and the casual segment and work from home segment has increased the open footwear. So, party wear, fancy wear have declined in leather shoes, outdoor shoes, but the casual footwear, open footwear has increased. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.976)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Correct. But even, let’s say, pre-pandemic open footwear used to be around 15% to 20% of the overall industry size, right, so if a large part of the industry has declined, the overall industry would have declined sharply, is my assessment correct? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: The major impact has come on leather shoes and outdoor shoes. So, that has declined tremendously and the gains are in open footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Okay. And in terms of competitive landscape, be it from unorganized players or organized players, how it has changed in last one year? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It’s a similar thing. The ASP has gone down, if you see as an industry the ASP has gone down because, again, the closed footwear being expensive have come down in share and the open footwear which are quite cheaper has gone up. So, similar thing with the un-organized also as well. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Okay. So, if, whatever the share of unorganized was pre-pandemic, is the share similar now or their overall share has come down of the overall pie? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.984)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: See, it is very difficult to measure, we don’t have a credible agency who can back the data that this is the percentage drop or this is the percentage increase. So, a guesstimate we can say, we have seen slight decrease. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Okay. My second question is, any fall out in terms of which brand of ours has done exceedingly well, be it Flite, Sparx or Relaxo? And in terms of geographies, which geography has seen healthy growth? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So, if you see, in India, Maharashtra and Kerala had maximum lockdowns, so these two states in West and South were impacted more. But North India and East India were doing pretty well. This is last year scenario. But currently it’s all lockdown so difficult to say. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Is the profitability same across all the geographies, sir? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, more or less it is same. It is only the freight which will be very less. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Okay. So, as most of our factories is in North, so if North does well then I believe the freight cost will be lower. So, that helps the margins?

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: Sir, my first question is that you mentioned that the closed footwear demand has been impacted in FY 2021, but as we sort of enter second half of this fiscal, it seems likely that post vaccination things could slowly start coming back. So, in your experience, is it possible to broadly quantify what could be the extent of pent-up demand? And when I say quantify meaning would it be 1.5x of normal demand, 2x of normal demand in your opinion, broadly at the sector level? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.553)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Sir, it is very difficult to quantify that, we have to wait and see. We don’t even know to what extent our lockdown will reduce today. Things are so chaotic, so unpredictable we have to just move the way things are accordingly. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: Sure. But you think that there will be an element of pent-up demand for sure, right? Because this particular demand cannot get lost, the closed footwear demand. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.981)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, the pent-up demand will be there, but there is lot of fear in the minds of the people. Even when the lockdown is lifted I don’t think people will immediately start moving very freely. It will take some time, and then hopefully things will improve. This is what we think. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.837)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: Sure. Secondly sir, how are we prepared in the event there is a strong pent-up demand, are we carrying enough inventory to sort of meet that demand? Or can we push our factories to meet that demand? How are we prepared on that front? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.922)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have inventory also; at the same time we have production capacities also. So, we always have a cushion in our production capacity and we generally utilize 70%. So, we have cushion in our hands. Having inventory also doesn’t mean that we can have unlimited inventory, that also you have to take care. But the way things will pan out, accordingly we will take decisions and actions. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: And lastly sir, at the company level, is it fair to say that the volume decline for the full year was in the range of 8% to 9% and across open wear and closed wear, in open wear we would have grown but in the closed footwear we would have seen significant volume decline, is that a fair assessment? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, last year actually our volume grew by around 7% because slipper sale was much more than the closed footwear, and that is low value segment. But because demand was much more of slippers, and our sale is only 2% less, so we could only make up because our slipper sale was more. So, actually volume was driven by around 7% growth. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: Okay. So, this realized increase of 7% was for the quarter and not for the full year? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Full year, we are talking about full year volume. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: Sir, I just want to understand, has there been an overconsumption situation in FY 2021 for open footwear, which could potentially mean softer demand in FY 2022? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, it doesn’t mean that. You would require slipper always, last year’s slipper cannot be used this year, after all there is limited life of a product. Anybody requires at least two slippers in a year, so that demand is going to remain. Once the things start opening up consumption will begin, consumption is there even today, even if you are indoor you still require slipper, you are not barefooted, consumption is still there. So, last year consumption cannot affect this year consumption, this is what I want to say. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: Okay. Sir, had the second wave not happened, say, you were sitting in the month of February and looking out into FY 2022, what is the growth you would have probably looked at? I mean, what kind of numbers were you people looking at internally, assuming that second wave is not going to happen. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, it would have been much better, because after all the whole month of May we have lost and in April also sales were affected. So, there is no point in just dreaming with those things, what could have happened. But now let us face what the reality is. The reality is, COVID wave is there and things are affected. We have to see now how our June pans out and how our second quarter pans out, that is what we have to see, that’s important. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Girish Pai 
Text: Okay. Lastly, sir at some point in time, I think three, four years back you had started this distribution restructuring where you focus more on exclusive distributors. Now, has the journey come to an end or are we still on this journey? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Sir, we are on the journey. Always you keep on improving the way of working. Today also we are doing the same thing and putting DMS system on those people, encouraging more-and-more people to become exclusively, our distributors selling our products. Then looking at their areas, territories how we can make them more responsible, how we can make them more efficient, how we can add retailers to them, more of a universe being created. So, it is a never-ending exercise. Even the best things can be made better, so we are always on it. And even today it is an ongoing exercise.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Sir, just wanted to understand the premiumization trend, how much was the premium product sold in the year, given that open footwear in the first half we saw a lot of premium Flite and others being sold, while closed footwear was more entry level products. So, by the end of the year how did that change happen? And from FY 2020 to FY 2021, has the premiumization overall increased significantly for us, which should have also aided some gross margins? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, last year was a tough year. Rather, we had to introduce a lot of value for money articles. So, as a result, our receipt per pair average price was lower, more slippers sold, although in the slipper segment we did add premium segments also. But ultimately, because shoe segment was not selling, and in shoe segment we had to introduce value-for-money shoes. So, overall, last year our average selling price came down, although volumes went up. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.987)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Sure. Sir, my second question is regarding the school category, how big is the school category for us and how much is the inventory in the system for the schools? Because last year schools didn’t start, and this year with the uncertainty in the schools there could be a lot of pent-up demand from the school side. So, if you could just share on how does the school footwear industry work for us? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It is a very small share in our scheme of things. Around 1% in share in our scheme of things, 1.5% or so, that’s all. And otherwise, basically schools are still closed so there is no shoe consumption at all. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Right. And sir, my last question is regarding the new BIS certification guidelines for footwear manufacturers, which is compulsory from 1st of July. How will that change the unorganized sector, because it will be very hard for them to get this certification? And do you see post this, in the second half, a good market share gain for organized footwear compared to unorganized footwear come in? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: First of all, on this guideline, our association is in regular talks with BIS and the government. And they are likely to postpone the implementation of this. And it will take time, because it is very confusing and even they are not clear. They used a word; I will just give one example, they say, rubber Hawai Chappal will attract to these things. But nobody makes rubber Hawai Chappal, what is the meaning of it, even they are not clear. When we asked them, what is rubber Hawai Chappal, they are not able to explain. Because these things they have picked up, it was from 20 years back what was happening. So, they are now in talks with us, our industry is talking to them, and they have understood the things. And accordingly, the likelihood is that implementation of these guidelines will be postponed for quite some time,.

Text: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be taking the last question that is from the line of Mr. Gaurav Jogani from Axis Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Sir, first question is with regards to, how much of the cost that we were able to save in FY 2021, how much of that can we sustain going ahead, I mean, in FY 2022? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I would say 3% to 4% was the saving. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Of the overall savings side? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Of the that expenditure we are going to do this year. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: So, basically, whatever we have been able to save last year, approximately 3% to 4% of which we can save this year, is that understanding correct? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we have to again watch the market scenario and take decisions accordingly. We may have planned something, but ultimately you have to see the market scenario and decide whether it is a pricing, whether it is brand building, whether it is business promotion expenses, everything we have to see, it is a dynamic environment in which we are operating. You cannot just say it is writing on the wall, you do it like this. If the market dynamics change, we have to change our things also. So, that is a way things move, not that once we plan then we go, we have to see the environment. Environment is dynamic and we have to be flexible accordingly, that is what we will be acting on. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Sure. And sir, my next question is with regards to the replacement cycle in the footwear industry. So, have you seen any changes over the past 5 to 10 years, earlier like people used to replace it every one year, two year, has that replacement cycle gone down on an overall basis, have you seen any trends as such? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.981)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we can only say, earlier our per capita footwear consumption, guesstimate, 1.5 pair, now this guesstimate is 2 pairs per capita consumption. So, definitely what reflects consumption has gone up only because of this, many people are keeping more pairs than what they were keeping earlier. And as far as the poor man is concerned, those who wear slippers their consumption anytime is two, because one slipper lasts hardly six months, around six months, so he has to buy two pairs. But overall consumption of footwear has gone up because there is a variety, there is fashion. So, because of fashion itself people buy more than one pair, so that is the way consumption has increased. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Sure. Sir, last question from my end is, what is your CAPEX guidance for the year FY 2022, this coming year? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Around Rs. 140 crores to Rs. 145 crores is what we have planned. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Good afternoon. I am Sushil Batra from Relaxo. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the Q2FY21. We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation; hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q2 FY21 financial performance followed by H1FY21 financial performance. In Q2 FY21, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of Rs. 576 crore as compared to Rs. 622 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The drop in Revenue in Q2 is due to disruptions in economic activities caused by COVID-19 pandemic. Benign raw material prices and saving in administrative expenses led to an improvement in the EBITDA margin to 22% as against 16.8% in same quarter last year. Other income stood at Rs. 5 crore as compared to Rs. 2 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase is mainly on account of lease rent waiver/reduction of Rs. 2 crore agreed by lessors for our rented premises. Profit before tax was Rs. 100 crore for the quarter, up by 35% YoY with a PBT margin of 17.4%. Tax expenses for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2020 reflect changes made vide Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019 as adopted by the Company. Therefore, effective tax rate of quarter ended September 30, 2020 is not comparable with previous comparative period of September 30, 2019 as the Company had recognised the full impact of this change in Profit & Loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Profit after tax at Rs. 75 crore for the quarter, is up by 6% YoY with a PAT margin of 13.0%. For First half of FY 2021, we registered a revenue of Rs. 939 crore as compared to Rs. 1,270 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. EBITDA margins increased to 19.6% from 16.6% while PAT margins increased to 10.6% from 9.5% helped by favourable raw material prices. At the end of Sep 30th, 2020, we have 396 exclusive brand outlets which contributed around 5% to our H1FY21 revenues. We have added net 6 new stores in this period. Exports are also picking up with opening of markets and are contributing around 4% of revenues. Going forward, we are cautious about the recent rising trend of raw material prices. We would continue our efforts to grow our presence in untapped and under- penetrated markets and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.

Text: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question is from the line of Archana Gude from IDBI Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Archana Gude 
Text: Thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on good set of numbers. I have three questions from my side. Firstly, I would like to know how was the demand scenario in Q2 and some color on the brand wise performance for us? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.652)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: After the opening up, northern markets like Delhi was the first one to open up, so in Q2 we saw good demand picking up from the rural India. If you see brand wise, in the close footwear category majorly, there has been impact, but in open footwear we are getting a good demand for the Hawai brand, the Flite brand and the Bahamas. So, there is a good demand coming in open footwear. The second thing is work from home is also happening so there is more demand of open footwear and less for the closed shoes. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Archana Gude 
Text: I was just going through your presentation and it suggests that we do not have presence through EBO in Southern India, your comment on this, is that intentional or how you intend to grow in the southern market? Ramesh Kumar Dua : Our purpose of EBO is a little different, strategic one. They are kind of display and exhibition of our products on the sale counters where our purpose is to capture the voice of the consumer and accordingly develop the new products so that we can understand the evolving need of the consumers about our products, the new products that we have launched, so currently we have around 400 outlets, but that is enough to understand the market. But if you want to go to south and west then it is a different thing commercially and then it must make economic sense. Today it is serving us marketing sense, where we understand the market, so from that point of view our objective is being well met with, so currently we do not have any plans to have such kind of outlets in other parts of the country. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Archana Gude 
Text: Some guidance on the raw material price trend and what kind of sustainable EBITDA margin you look forward let us say for FY2021 and 2022? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: So far, the raw material prices have been quite benign. In the fourth quarter that is January, February, March, definitely the prices are going to change, and things will be different, so we have to wait and see how actually the things fold up and then we will decide the way things are. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Archana Gude 
Text: Just a follow up on my last question. Given the category of footwear we are into, is it really easy to pass on any price hike if the raw material prices go up or how we look at the situation Sir? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.922)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It depends upon what kind of price hike or what kind of prices have changed in the raw material, in case its nominal we do not want to intervene at that stage, but if there is major then we do review the costing of our products and we pass it, then it is not difficult. Any price hike based on genuine input increase is never questioned, it is only when we want to increase the price without any genuine reason then that is questionable, so that is our policy which we have been following in the entire history of Relaxo and we will continue to follow. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Archana Gude

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ritesh Gupta from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Thanks for taking my question. Just continuing on the RM and the gross margin EBITDA, we have seen some of the best gross margin being posted in this quarter, I think much better than what we have reported in a very long history, so would be attributed to the crude price collapsing and that come into the benefit and is there any price hike? I think I remember you had about 2%, 3% price hike few months back, is it impacting? and just remind us from what kind of pricing action taken in the last six months or so if you have any and I think gross margins is also not understandable in the sense that the close footwear has been reasonably weak and probably it might have had some impact on the mix as well, so just wanted to understand the gross margins a bit and is there any one off in these numbers. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The current situation we are in, things are changing a little. In the first six months, expenses were controlled, other administrative expenses we have controlled. Now when the market will start opening up then we will have to do more expenses on marketing sales promotion, brand building and all that. There was saving on travel expenses, and other administrative expenses also. The raw material also was quite comfortably priced. On the one hand prices of raw material will go up, well travel expenses, marketing and branding will go up as well. So, this what we have achieved in Q2 does not mean it is going to be the norm of the day. We have to be in the market in a competitive manner and accordingly have to take decisions. So as far as third or fourth quarter is concerned, our expenses will be more, so this kind of EBITDA margin should not be expected. Margin will be good, better, but it will be in a more reasonable manner. Let us wait how the raw material prices move which we will come to know in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, whenever some intervention of price increase is required then we will do, we have to review it every quarter, what are the prices of the raw material, other inputs, market scenario, competitiveness of the articles in the market and then we have to take a mature decision on that. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: If you could highlight was there any reduction and discounts etc., you gave in the last quarter given probably your competition may be facing supply side challenges? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.841)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Definitely, in trade level also, the discounts offered were low and same thing happen in ATL and BTL expenditure also, it was not there in Q2. So, everything started in Q3 be it advertisement, BTL, ATL and the promotion scheme for the distributor and retailers. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.985)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Would you be able to guide us on, what kind of volume growth did you have this quarter? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Volume growth is 2%. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Any benefit that you are seeing from COVID on a long term basis like at the lower end of slipper portfolio, there are many unorganized players as well have you seen any kind of disruptions on that side, any opportunity to gain market share? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Actually what has happened because of COVID, work from home culture is here to stay, so the demand for the slippers and open footwear category will maintain at least for two to three years what we are seeing and the outgoing party wear is reducing, so for us we make informal footwear and specifically open footwear, so I think for two to three years this will continue. The demand will be more. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.957)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: If I again squeeze a last one, on the export side I think in the last call you had said that you are looking at export much more aggressively and you are looking at couple of global markets as well, I think you made this comment I think AGM or probably in your last call, I just wanted to understand is there a thought process on any specific countries we are targeting or any competitive advantages that you carry with yourself in those export markets, so if you can just talk about that could also be helpful. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: In export markets, it has been a similar position like India. After COVID market had been affected in same way in international market also and what is your other question you are asking? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.65)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: I just wanted to see that what are the competitive advantages as you get into some of the other market? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: We have been exporting in our own brand name so that is helping us out, because that we are getting sustainable growth year-on-year, because of using our own brand. The maximum footwear industry i.e. China and other countries, they always provide products in the private label, but we are doing in our own name and brand, so that is giving us advantage for the future. Majorly we are focusing on Gulf markets which are a major market for us, side by side we are getting now traction from Africa region and Oceania and Central America, these are the four regions where we are getting traction from. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Is it that you are able to provide these products at cheaper prices even what Chinese or Bangladesh competition would be I do not know which countries are larger competitor? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.991)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: Whatever quality standard we are maintaining in India, we are following the same quality standard wherever we are entering into, so our price points are higher than the Chinese counterpart wherever we are selling, but we are able to get the sales due to the quality standards that we are maintaining. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: Thank you so much and good evening to the management. Three questions from my side. The first one was, I look at your recovery rate in terms of volume or revenue for this quarter, it has been better than lot of the other similar categories, so first of all just wanted to get a sense that at the end dealer or retail level is the growth in volumes and revenue similar or there has been a channel filling that had help improve the reported number at our end? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Can you repeat the question please? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: Sir, I was asking that when I look at your revenue degrowth of just 7% and in the volume growth of 2%, the recovery has been much better than anticipated, so I just wanted to get a sense that is the recovery at the end dealer level also similar or there has been some sense of increase in inventory in the channel because that may have got a little reduce because of limited supply initially, so that is the first question. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Both things have happened. The pipeline got empty in starting of Q2 and secondly, there is a high demand coming from the Bharat or rural India what we call, so demand for open footwear is quite high and definitely availability has improved from our factories and it has helped us to grow. It is similar with the retailer and distributor. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: Our end territory sales or end level sales would be more or less similar to the company reported sales at this point in time for Q2? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: That is helpful. I am not sure, but do you disclose a share of e-commerce and approximately what was the contribution for this quarter? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: E-commerce we are doing 10% of our total sale if we say Q2, but Q1 it was all closed, so there was no sale coming in Q1, Q2 is 10% growth compared to last year Q2. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: 10% growth and as a share of our total sales what it would be e-commerce contribution? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.836)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: That is also 10%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: Last question from my side. Traditionally whenever we have seen a spurt in gross margin because of falling raw material prices, ideally how do we end up using the benefit, do we end up cutting prices or end up increasing our ATL, BTL expense, just wanted a sense of that scenario in case of it plays out ahead? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.991)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to see, for a normal duration of time, it is not in one month prices go down and then we have to take some radical decision, we have to see how this three month or six months plays out. If I find today the raw materials have gone down, but I find in third quarter they are going to come up, so then we have taken decision, by and large if you see a longer period i.e. six months or more, the things average out, so no immediate intervention is required for any kind of things. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: Absolutely Sir, but I am just saying that in case there is a sustained continuation of the current gross margins and would we say look at reducing prices? Ramesh Kumar Dua : Already I have told you Q4 raw material prices are going up, we are booking the material at a new rate, which are quite high rather it is situation other way round I do not know in the Q4 we may have to look for upward revision of the prices. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Nihal Jham 
Text: I will come back in the queue if I have more questions. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tejas Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Thanks for the opportunity and good evening. You spoke about channel wise split of the growth if you can give some color on region wise also if any particular region or South India in particular did better than others? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.981)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: South India and West India, they did not pickup because as everybody knows Maharashtra was last to open up similarly Kerala is still under lock down, so South India and West India is hardest hit, so the best part for us was we have done very well in north region and east region, which was less effected and opened up quite early. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.992)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: South India will be materially degrowth versus our reported numbers or they are in the vicinity of our reported numbers? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ritesh Dua 
Text: They are in degrowth, no doubt about it. South India is in degrowth, because it was last to open up. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Sir, second question is you spoke that we were able to make stuff available versus competition and I am assuming as we have noticed in many other categories that unorganized had much more supply shock than organized players, so would it be fair assumption that you have gained market share in the last two quarters versus unorganized and once they stabilized the supply chain perhaps the competitive pressure might come back in the coming quarters? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, you are right. Initially we got good market in those first and second quarters, but now the supply coming from the competition, so the competitive edge is not as relevant what it was before. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: If you can give some color on how the festive season is going so far, how was Durga Pooja and when do you see the recovery coming back only for us and for the sector at large? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.816)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: October has been nice for us and the festive season picked up, now all the markets are open except Kerala, so we are getting good recovery there, 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: This is across states or in the sense you spoke about Bharat versus urban, so urban is also participating now? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, definitely, everywhere across.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Good evening team and congrats on a decent set of number. My first question is with respect to category growth, so I understand there is no data, but any ballpark number what would helping the category declining in Q2? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.845)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: One of the category which has not grown or rather declined is canvas shoes, Schoolmate, because schools are closed, and close category whether it is sports, people are not moving out, so that category has affected, but other articles like where there are open footwear, slipper, sandals, they are all right, not an issue. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.99)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Normally shoes as a category is how big in terms of overall footwears? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Around 10%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We do not have formals; we have all informal. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: But I am talking about the category as a whole? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The category for the country or for us? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: For the country, for the industry? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I cannot tell on that; I can tell about my company. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: My second question is you told that open footwear is doing well, we understand that open footwear as a category is doing quite well and normally earlier open footwear used to be more of a seasonal category where largely used to sell more in summer, when summers will be approaching, so can there be any manufacturing glitch because the demand will be much higher and so do we have the capacity to manufacture the increasing demand, if it comes? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have good capacity. Already we have capacity cushion of 30%- 40% more, so that will not be an issue. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: My last question in terms of overall dealers, for dealers it would help in a very difficult time in last six months, so have you seen any of our dealers close down, any thoughts on that? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.624)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: I have told before also that in West India and South India, there has been a big problem because of opening up late. So many shops have closed, but it is still difficult to say what is the exact number, because as you know Kerala is still under lockdown and Mumbai also has been majorly hit, so we do not have exact data right now, but definitely there has been some closures. In terms of the channel trade, distributors, they are working, they are intact. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.98)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: So the retail universe may come down, but for us the channel distributors are same, they have not declined right? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.984)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: They have not declined. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Definitely we are seeing demand coming from all across India for the open footwear, so we have increased the number of distributors and dealers. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Text: Secondly, Sir we understand there has been some increase in deposits from distributors. Is it possible to highlight, what could be the reason for this? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: We have increased the security amount from each distributor for new distributor as well as the existing distributor, so just to bring more big and serious people in the business, so that is why this amount has increased in last six months as we were working on that. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It was in pipeline, after COVID we implemented in June otherwise it was to be implemented in April itself. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: Okay and what is the capex and capacity expansion plan if you can share something on that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Every year we have a spending around Rs.100 Crores so this year also that plan is there and accordingly capacity expansion which are in progress already declared around a lakh of pairs per day, so that will be in place by 31st March. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Bharat Chhoda 
Text: Considering post normalization could we be in a position to see double digit growth post normalization, is it possible for us? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No. Presently, we have to recover what we have lost in the first quarter, so currently also we have not recovered that, so first our job is to recover, how long will it be, let us wait and see. I do not think if this year we can recover whatever turnover reached last year. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.976)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Thank you for the opportunity Sir. My question is with regards to your retail outlet reach, so as per your presentation we reached approximately 50,000 outlets as of now. Can you help with what would be the entire universe of the retail reach and what is the target that we have in mind to reach with the expansion plan that we have. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: What data we have collected personally there are about one lakh outlets in India and currently we are at 50,000, so our target is always to increase double digit like 10% to 15% every year to add on new outlets. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: Okay, but I was doing a tertiary check through various websites and all, the people like VKC and Paragon they already talk about 1.5 lakh outlets to 2.5 lakh outlets already, so I mean is there some difference in that bit? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We cannot say about others, , so this exercise the company has done we have identified 1 lakh outlets., so they got data from somewhere else, we do not have that data.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Text: Basically it is only for your category outlets which you are talking about? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No EBOs. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jogani 
Text: In terms of capex you have already mentioned, you would be already doing Rs.100 Crores capex this year as well, how much capacity you get additionally out of that and wouldn’t it suffice for the next two to three years then we can stop for the capex? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Every year after all company has to grow, we have to think which way, what category, how it has to be grown. There are certain expenditures like moulds, it is regular capital expenditure. Then machineries, lot of machineries are being replaced. Then the third thing is capacity expansion. Capacity expansion also has to be done keeping in view the evolving or increasing demand of the different types of footwear. So whatever category is growing, accordingly we keep on moving ahead of the curve. Not that today demand will come then we will start planning. Just always create some system or cushion in the manufacturing capacity, so that we should not suffer any sale losses.

Text: Sir, just wanted to understand the impact on Sparx brand, it accounts for 30% of our revenue, is it safe to understand that now from Q3, we can see demand being pre-COVID level in Sparx or we will see demand only in Q4 and some pressure can be seen even now? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.659)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It is very difficult to say about Q4, but we are seeing some recovery in Sparx brand as well, but I am saying again West and South, not fully opened up, there are still issues at district level, so recovery is there, but when it will be recovered to pre-COVID level difficult to say right now. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.979)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: A related question to that is on the school shoes, canvas shoes as well, are you seeing schools reopen in certain parts and demand for school shoes coming back and that can be a big demand boost for us in the remaining six months of the year? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: My last question on A&P spends, could you quantify A&P spends in the first half of the year and what is the currently, what is the margin guidance for the full year given that previously we believe that margins could be flattish year-on-year at around 17% given the stupendous margins in the first half, do we see 100 to 150-bps better margins compared to last year in FY2021? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Compared to last year, we will have definitely better, but we should not take Q2 as the standard. In Q3, Q4 expenditure on account of marketing is definitely going to increase and schemes for the distributor channel will also be there. But on the whole what you see, this year our EBITDA margins will be better than last year. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Sir if I can squeeze it one more question on the EBO demand, how was the EBO demand? And for the full year how many more stores are we looking to open? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are controlling at around 400 for the time being. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ankit Kedia 
Text: Is the demand similar to the wholesale demand at the EBO or there is some pressure on that as well? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.959)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: There is a pressure on that, because visit to our own outlets remains affected. But for multi- brand outlets which are located in all areas like rural, sub-rural, urban, suburban markets, there demand is better.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I am not very clear on the question. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikunj Kela 
Text: If we put Rs.100 Crores of capex today, what is the revenue potential from that facility we can expect? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: That depends upon where you are putting the Capex. Suppose Capex goes in buying land, no capacity will change. You put Capex on building, no capacity will change. And you put on the machinery, what kind of machinery, what category of machinery, mould, so it is difficult. Every capex does not mean it will come out with the more capacity. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Nikunj Kela 
Text: If I may ask the question as if we are doing any Greenfield capex today and whatever capacity you have in mind of a particular line then in that what is the gross asset one can expect from that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have not gone like that because our categories like slippers, sandals, sport shoes and EVA slippers, EVA injection molding, there are so many categories, then what kind of process we are going to adopt, whether I am making shoe on a conventional category or I will make raw material and make a sole of it then I will also make chappal out of it. It will be different paradigm, what kind of policy I follow. One thing is to buy the sole and upper , it will be different output. But if you make the sole also yourself, you make the upper also yourself then output will be different. The capacity creation is not as simple as that what you are saying.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Abhimanyu Takkar 
Text: Sir, I just wanted to understand have we tried consolidating our supply chain, where earlier retailers had an option to choose amongst three, four distributors versus now there are exclusive distributors in the west especially I am speaking? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Last six months there is no change. We are continuing what we were doing before, so in COVID time we have not changed anything on the structure. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Abhimanyu Takkar 
Text: Where I am coming from is because in some of our channel checks we realized the availability of sizes is an issue at the MBO level wherein the distributors cannot stock all the sizes for all the retailers and hence we are losing out some customers due to this issue, like they are not getting all the sizes like earlier we had three, four distributors, so they could approach if A distributor does not have it, they will just approach B, just trying to figure it out like where we are trying to miss out on the channel changes? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.954)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: There are pros and cons with the policies. In some areas we have distributors where they have dedicated area, and it is one distributor giving to a retailer of that area. In some of the markets where the one distributor is not able to do then we have another distributor also. So, there is pros and cons. Wherever we are able to serve the markets with one distributor, we are going with that. Where it is not possible; there we are having multiple distributor. That is what we are doing. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Abhimanyu Takkar 
Text: Because the area where I actually spoke to there was an issue with respect to the availability of sizes, so I thought I will just convey to you in respect of the loss of customer 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.899)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: This problem is with practically for every distributor, because whatever finance, money they were able to put, sometimes they are not so organized that they are able to keep inventory of every article, every SKU, every color, every size. They do have sometime shortfalls and we try to prevail upon, they should maintain some inventory. But presently sometimes does happen, they have no stock for some articles.

Text: Thank you very much Sir. One question, these are the question earlier participant asked, how connected are we in terms of technology with our distributors? So, what is our replenishment cycle for the distributors on a normal period, can we see it further improving? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: If you ask about particular these six months which have passed, we have not changed any policy in terms of supply chain or addition or subtraction of our distributor. You are talking about supply to the distributor, generally we try to maintain two to three days across India. And for connectivity in terms of stock, we have implemented DMS, so we know what the secondary sale and stock level at the distributors is. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: We supply them not for six months but on a regular basis we supply them in two to three days. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes. That is our norm. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Normally the reason for stock outs will not be as much right for distributors because if they are able to supply them in two, three or four days on a regular basis? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes. But we asked the distributor to keep at least one month of inventory, because of having all the sizes and colors. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Then how do we help them improve their ROI, because that is a very important issue for our type of business where the number of SKUs are so high? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We have installed DMS at all distributor points, so we get the stock data and secondary sales data. So whatever stocks are getting accumulated we come to know, and the billing is stopped for that. And the secondary, our salespeople are able to help him liquidate that stock which is stuck. So, we keep on monitoring what stock level distributor is carrying. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: My second question, for this quarter and six months, I am seeing our inventory and receivables has come down quite a lot, is it just because of the value of the inventory has come down or we have made some changes over there? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: As soon as we opened our plants in May, so there was a huge demand coming for open footwear. so whatever inventory, we were carrying forward in month of March got exhausted in just 15 to 20 days. And to ramp up the production, it took time for one to one- and-a-half months. During that period the inventory went really low. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: We are talking of the September end, this Rs.368 Crores of inventory as on September 30, 2020? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Because the demand of open footwear is still very high and the production there is still a gap demand versus supply in some product categories. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.978)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: Sir, one last question. Over next two to three year period or over three year period, what is the sort of gross margins or EBITDA margins we should look at as a company aspiring so that is able to grow, invest and generate good amount of free cash? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.785)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It is dependent upon market condition, demand conditions, what kind of scenario we are in, what kind of product acceptance is happening, what categories we are focusing on. Generally, if you see it has been around 16%. And this quarter because of some certain reasons it has gone up, if we can achieve 18%, it should be a good one. But we must remain competitive also and we have to be remunerative also at the same time. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Mithun Soni 
Text: 18% is over next two to three year period or in a short period you are talking? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I am talking of this year. Then I will talk next year because we are living in a volatile time now where nothing is certain as such, today even our COVID incident is not over, fear is not over. We are in a very uncertain time, let some certainty come and then we will able to say with more confidence what kind of scenario is emerging.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It should increase at least by 2%, we are expecting 10% to 12% will be the contribution of e-commerce, we are targeting that. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aditya Bapat

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aditya Bapat 
Text: Okay, so then having said that do you think that not just for you, but for the industry or rather the organized players as a whole, the margins could come under pressure, because this overall e-commerce thing or online thing is inherently lower margin? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: No, we actually give same margins to channel trade and e-commerce, so we are not keeping any gap between e-commerce and the channel. we keep it same. Otherwise there will be a problem of discounting.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Thank you for the opportunity Sir. The first question is you talked about that once the market opened up there was significant pent up demand and production took time, so was there any loss of demand, did you fail to with any demand during Q2? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.917)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, definitely because the demand was quite high compared to stock what we were carrying, and it took time for factory to ramp up the production. So, at that time definitely we lost some sales. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Fair to say that sales, had there been no loss of demand, the recovery which you would have see at least 5%, 7% better than what you reported? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Not that big. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Secondly Sir, I understand that with marketing opening, most of your expenses would start going back to pre-COVID level. But have you looked at any cost rationalization in terms of any line items where you see structurally over the next three, four years, you will have lower cost versus what there was during the pre-COVID period and hence you will see some margin expansion from those particular line items? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Our marketing costs were low in the first quarter and second also, but third quarter it will now come back to pre-COVID level, we must continue building our brand. Now our people will also start traveling and expenses will start moving. And all these things will be there. As far as raw material expenses are concerned, they will depend upon how the international commodity behaves. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Is it fair to assume that all supply related and labour related challenges are now over and at least productions are almost back to pre-COVID level? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.913)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, but in certain category like shoe there were no demand and now only demand has started improving, so there we are ramping up the things now and some manpower training is also going on to improve our production levels.

Text: Just a clarification first you mentioned that 20% of our footwear or 10% of our footwear is closed footwear. Which numbers one should refer to? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes. If you go on a volume term it will be around 10%, but value term, the value will be 20%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Okay and when we see Sparx as a brand which is somewhere around 30% odd number as per our disclosure in the past, so is it a fair understanding then 20% by value from the 70% of out Sparx itself will be closed footwear? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: What I have told you it is regarding close footwear shoe, but in Sparx, there are also slippers. Not as a brand, I am talking as a category of the article, so sports shoes and sporty sandals that constitutes 20% of the turnover. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: I was just trying to deduce that Sparx will be somewhere around majority close footwear brands? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes, we have already been saying that it will be more than one third only now also. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Okay, second question, we have been hearing you for the last six, seven years and you have been pretty consistent on your margin commentary that you want to be competitive and you want to react to or rather respond to market situation rather than proactively chase margins. But during this journey we have expanded margins also from 12% to 17%, 18% now and obviously there was a one GST benefit also in between, but just wanted to understand the philosophy what do you benchmark your margins against, is it against the peer or margin is an outcome and you want to be competitive on pricing and you let the margin flow through whatever it comes to, so is it a goal seek in the pricing and margin is an outcome that is not under your control? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Focus is the consumer. First you have to understand what consumer is looking for and we have to first satisfy that need and consumer is looking for what price, so we have to make articles accordingly. And then everything goes back into it and if we are able to serve that need then we are able to expect good margins automatically out of it, but if you supply a fit product, you will not expect those margins at all. Rather sometime you have to sell article at a loss, so we have to always keep close contact, what is, you have already need as a consumer and set right to develop such products only, then only company will remain healthy and we will have better margins. So that lesson we are learning, and we are improving our portfolio accordingly. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

We cannot say if this philosophy will remain forever.

I had only one question just trying to understand results a little more at a granular level, we had a volume growth of 2% this quarter and sales decline of 7% and this gap is even despite lower cash discounts, lower trade spends and promotions and so on and just trying to understand why there is such a big gap between volume growth and sales decline, is it mix and if it is mix then it has actually benefitted our gross margins. so just a little more color on this number?

Text: It is a result of the mix, because closed articles have sold less and open articles are sold more and as in that open footwear or slippers and other things, where our one division Bahamas has grown much more. and they are premium category, so margin has been better in that category as a result thing have improved. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sameer Gupta 
Text: Just a followup Sir, is it that the realization in closed footwear is higher, but on a margin level they are lower than open footwear is this understanding correct Sir? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.983)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, in every category we have different articles giving different margins whether it is Hawai category, Bahamas category, Flite category, Sparx category, in every category we have some premium articles and we have some value for money articles. So, every category has to be like that and that is there.

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Good afternoon to everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the financial year 2019-20. We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation, hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q4 FY20 financial performance followed by Full year FY20 financial performance. In Q4 FY20, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of 540 cr down by 15% Year on Year. This impact was mainly due to nationwide lockdown. Due to adoption of IND AS 116, our rental expenses have reduced, and simultaneously depreciation and interest expenses have increased. The total impact of this new accounting standard on EBITDA is an increase of 45.23 cr. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 17.8% vs. EBITDA margin of 15% in Q4FY19. EBITDA margin of 17.8% for Q4FY20 stands at 15.7% without IND AS 116. As informed earlier our Company has chosen to exercise the option of lower tax rate of 25.168% as introduced by the Taxation Laws Ordinance 2019. Our Profit after tax was 52 cr for the quarter, down by 4.8% YoY with a PAT margin of 9.58%. For FY 2020, we registered a revenue of Rs 2410 cr, up by 5% with Gross margin of 56.88% and EBITDA margin of 17%. Favourable raw material prices and premiumization supported this growth. Our PAT of 226 cr in FY20 with a PAT margin of 9.4% grew by 29% YoY mainly due to cost control initiatives in manufacturing excellence and lower tax rates. During FY20, we generated a cash of 319 cr from operation and spent 208 cr in capex and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of 31st March, 2020, we have 390 exclusive brand outlets which contributed 8% to our FY20 revenues. We have added net 47 new stores in this period. Exports have expanded to new territories and is contributing 4% of revenues. During the ongoing crisis, we are undertaking all necessary measures to ensure safety and well-being of our employees and partners. The Company is strictly adhering to Government guidelines and have started operations in plants and offices. Prior to starting of operations, we have developed detailed SOP for safety of its employees. Proper equipment and sanitization material and mask has been provided at all locations. We continue to support and provide assistance to our dealers, distributors and customers. Due to nationwide lockdown overall demand for overall footwear is subdued but demand for open slipper segment has improved during the period. However due to restrictions in manufacturing operations fulfilment of such demand will be a challenge in short term. The Company has paid all long term debts in FY20 and its liquidity position is comfortable. Moreover, with start of business activities the liquidity position of the Company will continue to be comfortable. Relaxo has always been one of the most trusted brands and we believe that the Company is well placed to emerge stronger in post COVID world. We will continue to adopt strategic initiatives to strengthen our brand positioning, improve our product innovation and expansion into newer geographies. We can now open floor to questions. Thank you.

Text: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question is from the line of Tejas Shah from Spark Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Sir, first question is if you can give us some color on channel wise and region wise business scenario post lockdown and even in the recent weeks when lockdown has been relaxed? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Currently a lot of areas are still under lockdown, south and west markets are still in lockdown position. It is only the north, east and central where things are opening and there our business is picking up. So, till the lockdown in the western and southern markets is lifted, the business will remain challenge. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Roughly 70% to 80% of markets where you operate, are they open for business now? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: around 50% are open 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Now unlike other models your model is very MBU driven and I believe a lot of inventory would have been there because the lockdown was sudden, so ballpark figure on how many months of inventory you believe that will be in the channel already before you start seeing primary pickup happening at your level as well? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Inventory in the channel will be in the range of 60 days, but depends upon the dealer capacity as well. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Is it a fair assumption that it will take some time for us to see pickup in primary level because this was quite sudden shock in terms of demand planning and all? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.986)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Maybe by the next quarter things become clearer. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: You also mentioned in your opening remarks Mr. Batra, that we will be looking at new geographies for expansion this year, so any new territories we are planning or within the same areas we are planning for deeper penetration? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: All these are ongoing process, wherever we find that there is a market we keep on developing our distribution, finding distributor and expanding, that we have been doing in the past, and would continue doing so. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: There was a very strong trust when we started this year on online channel you call out in your half-year call as well so what is the exact contribution from this channel as on March for the full year? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: 7% to 8%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Lastly one bookkeeping question, looking at the demand scenario are we planning to do any major capex this year now? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No major capex, but it is ongoing process, so wherever and whatever is the need will be done, for example there are molds, small machineries etc. In the past it was around 100 Crores, this year also we expect that kind of a capital expenditure. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: That is all from my side Sir. I will fall back in queue for more questions. Thanks. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kaustubh Pawaskar from Sharekhan Limited. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: Sir my question is on the current situation since the lockdown is gradually improving and people would be getting out of home and still the permissions are not at the optimum level so which of the categories of Relaxo would see higher demand in the current situation, also schools have not reopened, which of the categories would see demand in the current situation? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: From our experience, open footwear i.e PU, EVA, Hawai, Bahamas is in demand more than the sports shoes or sporty sandals. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.909)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: What would be the approximate contribution from this to your overall revenue? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Two third. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: It is expected that the schools would reopen somewhere in the August, which at current juncture look to be unlikely, but the government is planning to slowly start with the educational institutions, so can we expect the school demand or demand for the school shoes to pickup post August maybe in September and what is the contribution from that particular category for you? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It is very insignificant. School shoes are very insignificant contribution in our scheme of things. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: One question on the raw material prices, this quarter despite the fact that the revenues were down and on gross margins level we have seen significant improvement, so how is the raw material cost position now and do you expect this gross margin expansion to sustain in the coming quarters? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Raw material prices have been by and large stable in the last year and this quarter also they will be benign, so we would be able to sustain this level of margin. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: I can squeeze in, in your presentation you mentioned that the Indian contribution to overall global export is just 2% compared with China, which was at around 40%, so post-COVID do you expect this contribution to go up, are you seeing some kind of orders coming from the international markets, which have slowly started opening up? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we are already doing lot of effort in our export promotion, but even overseas markets have been impacted 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: Correct. Okay, thanks for the opportunity. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bhargav Buddhadev from Kotak Mutual Fund. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: Sir assuming that the demand comes back by say September or maybe October do you think that we can sort of ramp up production to say around 80%, 90% by September, October? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.692)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Now once we see the demand coming, we will be able to utilize our capacities to ramp up, I think migrated labors will also start returning. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: In terms of your vendors from where you sort of procure raw material, semi raw materials or semi finished goods how is the situation over there? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Supply is not an issue. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: So, you do not think there will be any production challenges by September? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.972)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: From the raw material point of view no challenge. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: Secondly Sir what could be two or three cost saving levers, which you can sort of use to contain cost in FY2021? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.52)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Depending on market conditions we will relook into our sales incentive schemes, brand building exercises and try to reduce some cost in other areas. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: There were a few new competitors who had emerged and who gave us a strong competition on the Sparx brand especially the footwear segment, the sport shoe segment, so post lockdown do you see these new entrants continuing with their competitive intensity or you think they will sort of slowdown? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Competition is always there, and it is a healthy part of business. We have been growing at fairly good rate even with the competition and expect to continue doing so. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: Do you think FY2022 can be better than FY2020? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: At the moment market conditions are very unpredictable. We need to observe, quarter by quarter development on how market evolves. FY2022, I think it should be better than 2020. By that time things will be very clear and stabilized, things are expected to be very good. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Bhargav Buddhadev 
Text: Okay Sir. Thank you very much I will come back in the queue.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhruv Bhimrajka 
Text: Sir want some details on your raw material procurement and sourcing so what are the main raw materials that you use, do you source it locally or through exports can you just give a detailed description about that we do? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: In the non-leather footwear industry there are lot of materials, main are the polymers like natural rubber, ethyl vinyl acetate, JVC, PU, certain material like EVA and PU are imported, but that is not an issue. Natural rubber is available locally also. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhruv Bhimrajka 
Text: If I have to ask this EVA and PU, which is imported what are the major countries that you import them from? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: 7-8 countries. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhruv Bhimrajka 
Text: That would be great and what would be the largest component of raw material say rubber is what part of your raw material component, but if you could just give us range that would also be helpful? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: As on date largest is EVA, followed by PU and natural rubber. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhruv Bhimrajka 
Text: What would the percentage be Sir? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Article wise different consumption, difficult to tell. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhruv Bhimrajka 
Text: But these three would be the major raw materials? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: As far as polymers are concerned, Polymer is the main cost in non-leather footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhruv Bhimrajka 
Text: Last question, what would be breakup of revenue for north, south, east, west India? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Different articles will have different things, open slippers are having different scenario, products like Sparx have a different scenario. It will be difficult to give regionwise break of revenue.

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Dhaval Mehta from ASK Investment. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Sir my question is related to open footwear this is a category where you are seeing right now maximum growth, so how is the competitive intensity in this category because where I am coming from is that in this category predominantly the unorganized pie was doing a sizable business, so have they are facing constraint in terms of manufacturing, which is helping us, so I just wanted to know more about it? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Competition is part of every business and we have been coexisting for last so many years, so there is nothing to fear from it. Some of the local players are also getting organized so that is not an issue. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: So even the local or the unorganized players are back in full capacity, so they are not facing more of a manufacturing constraint as of now, is this the right assessment? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.991)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: What are they internally doing I cannot comment on that. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: My second question is with respect to our distributors, our distributors income will also be impacted because of the lockdown so are we giving some extended credit or helping them in terms of by supporting them in terms of few of the benefits, is that happening or how the things are there at the distributor end? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.988)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, it is not necessary, currently demand is there with supply constraint. We are giving less discounts to retailers, so distributors are able to make up their margin accordingly. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.987)

Speaker: Dhaval Mehta 
Text: Most of our factories are located in the northern region and the south and the west market was the market where we were getting maximum growth so when you expect the supply chain to be normalized and is it already normalized? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: In south the markets have not opened; supply chain is a challenge but it’s not that we are not able to supply. Once demand starts coming in, we can serve those markets also. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: The next question is from the line of Ritesh Gupta from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Sir just to kind of ask the same question again which other participants have asked, so you touched almost 60% gross margin this quarter and I can see that crude prices have turned even more benign versus where let us say I would assume that you would keep an inventory of three, four months, so the inventories at which probably you will be procuring some of the polymers might have further fallen and that inventory probably will come in your consumption in the next three to four months, so should we expect that margins may improve and you have been indicating that you have been taking some price hikes also, so on a broader basis should this 60% gross margin that you have reported can actually further improve is that a fair expectation in FY2021? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to watch market conditions, and see what kind of demand is coming up in different categories. With most of the new ways of SOP setting in the factory, lot of precaution are being taken, social distancing is being maintained, so production capacity of every unit is getting affected, so that is one way we will be raising our cost. So in three, four months we will really know where we stand as far as the cost is concerned, accordingly then we will take appropriate steps. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.753)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Sure Sir. No, the question here is on the gross margin side, so I understand that will impact your operational cost and your employee cost, etc., but purely from a raw material standpoint let us see even if I look at from 1Q FY2020 to 4Q FY2020 you have improved from 54% to 60%, which in a way tells me that the raw material benefits come to you with a lag, but essentially even from a 4Q level the RM prices have declined and RM prices clearly will not have any impact of social distancing, etc., so that was my question is it that you hedge your inventory to some extent and hence some of the benefits may not be there in the future quarter or it is a usual three-month lag, which inventory is kind of get back into your gross margins? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Ritesh I think you are seeing only Q4, you have to see full year performance say gross margin in full year is around 57% so do not expect that 60% margin will be there in every quarter. In Q4 you can see there is increase in inventory, there is a less trading good so it has impacted and that is why it looks like there is a big jump in the margin, but that is not the case let us see the full year, which is around 57% that is sustainable again subject to so many things how manufacturing take shape and how material prices cost and then we will take the appropriate action so don’t get carried away with Q4 results, let us see the full year results and that will be a right indicator of the performance. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.89)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Got it Sir and just another thing I think you also talked about distribution incentives, etc., and this is general question in a market wise demand probably would be we are just seeing some bit of challenges do you think you will have to, how should we think about the discounting at the trade level would the discounting at the trade level would increase to clear the inventories or you may have to give better margins to distributors to push your products how does that happen and in that context how much is the pricing flexibility that you have as well would you have to roll back some of the price hikes you have done in the past? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.933)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: If you see the market, we have three brands one is Sparx, Flite and then Bahamas. In the open footwear there is a lot of demand coming up because in India migrants labour is going back, and due to lockdown people are sitting at home so demand of open footwear has gone up compared to the closed footwear. Three to six months from now on I think the demand can pickup for closed footwear. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Got it Sir and you told us that the ratio is two third to one third? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, correct. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devang Mehta 
Text: Just wanted to understand on the current strategy of streamlining distributors we have called out by the lot of them from more than 900 to 700 now so is the process over or how do we see this number of distributors and the regions that we are adding? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: So now currently we have 800 distributors, last year we have added more than 100 new distributors and new territories, it is an ongoing process, but because of COVID for the last three months nothing is happening and we suspect next one or two months will remain same, post that again the drive of finding new distributor new territory will be there. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Devang Mehta 
Text: What will be the universe of retailers, endpoints for footwear in India? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: See what data we have collected last year, we discussed in last meeting that it was 75000 we have updated the list to 85000 outlets and our presence is roughly around 45000 outlets, so this I am talking about direct reach, indirect reach is much more. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devang Mehta 
Text: 45000 is direct without wholesale that is what I understand right? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Correct. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devang Mehta 
Text: In terms of inventory in the system you said there is 60 days of inventory in the channel and the demand is weak and for especially the closed footwear the demand is weak, so how do we see new footwear being so, are we going to obviously there will be some slack in terms of new design, but how do we see launching new products going forward? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: I think we must recalibrate our strategy and go for value for money product more because premiumization in this scenario looks little difficult. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.958)

Speaker: Devang Mehta 
Text: That would be across all the categories? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Correct. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Devang Mehta 
Text: Okay great thanks a lot.

Speaker: Moderator 
Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sumant Kumar from Motilal Oswal. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sumant Kumar 
Text: My question is regarding the volume degrowth in FY2020 2.7% so is it because of full lockdown or some product mix changes, low end product we have sold lesser and high end product we have sold more, so we have seen overall 8% realization growth also in FY2020, so can you elaborate what are the key reasons for that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushi Batra 
Text: Degrowth is 2.7%, it is right, it is a mixture of both lockdown and definitely we could not sell in the last 10 - 15 days in the month of March. In full year, if you see we were selling more premium product and with lot of value addition, that is why value was growing much faster than the volume and the lockdown has impacted it, that is why this growth in volume is -2.7%. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sumant Kumar 
Text: So, going forward our focus is more to sell our value added product so whatever the low end product like you have Relaxo Hawai and Bahamas that realization is lower so going forward we have a higher growth in that other segment? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.513)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, here it depends upon the market. Currently market demand for this value footwear is more especially for Hawai slipper, Bahamas, Flite, so we are selling them accordingly. Brand like Sparx shoes is there, but volume is always more in these kinds of verticals. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sumant Kumar 
Text: So like Relaxo, Hawai plus Bahamas, Flite and then Sparx three broader category? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: High value I think just we have been sharing that there are three categories majorly. So one is the Relaxo including Bahamas then second category is Flite for youth that is the fast growing brand and the third is Sparx. You can say Hawai segment is one fourth, I am talking about the last year number and the rest of the categories are 50:50.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Neerav Chavaye 
Text: Sir my question is more regarding this open footwear and closed footwear category, so we are leader in this open footwear category so just wanted to understand from a strategy point from that for the next two to three years how much revenue do we target from this closed footwear category particularly the Sparx brand? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: You know in Sparx, we have various segments of footwear, there is sporty sandal, there are SFG [Sparx fabricated sleepers (Gents)], there are slippers, and there are canvas sport shoes also. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Neerav Chavaye 
Text: For the sports shoe side particularly? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: In Sparx or overall? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Total overall. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Between 5% to 10% is the sports shoe segment, what we are catering. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Neerav Chavaye 
Text: If we were to see that revenue or realizations from that would it be substantially higher maybe 50%, 60% or even more than that realization of the product? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: If you compare this with the basic Hawai slipper then definitely it is much higher, but on overall revenue point of view it is between 5% to 10%. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Neerav Chavaye 
Text: Internally do we foresee a larger opportunity here in the next two to five years where the demand can be higher? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It is little doubtful because we are waiting for the winter season to come and then we have to see how the closed footwear performs. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: This year because of COVID-19 challenge. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Neerav Chavaye 
Text: Right, but I am saying in particular if we see for the next two to three years from a strategic point of view is there a big shift where you see this at a larger opportunity since your penetration in this segment? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Pre-COVID you can say because everybody was saying pre-COVID it was there, but post COVID how it will be we have to wait and watch. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Neerav Chavaye 
Text: Also another thing is gross margins for our company for the last three quarters has been consistently growing even in this quarter it was about 600 basis points up so how much do you see is mainly for on account of lower raw material prices and how much can be on the back of premiumization? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: we see the overall cost and accordingly we do the pricing so that we are able to sustain the margins. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Neerav Chavaye 
Text: So, you feel that from at least one or two quarters point of view this premiumization thing would have a problem so like to understand that ASPs would go down in spite of lower raw material pricings? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: ASP will definitely go down when cheaper slippers or value slippers are selling, but gross margins and other things we would be able to sustain. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Neerav Chavaye 
Text: Also just wanted to understand the competitive intensity when we compare this two imported footwear and a lot of it also comes from China and India in this category so how do you see things changing on that side and those are not larger branded products do we compete hard with them or they are even cheaper? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.779)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we have no competition, there is nothing to worry on that front and other way also government is protecting. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Neerav Chavaye 
Text: Being a branded player there is no big challenge from imported footwear company? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we don’t have much. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Neerav Chavaye 
Text: The last question if you can just help us online as a channel how much does it contribute for our category of products from Relaxo point of view? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Around 10%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Text: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Saurabh Pant from SBI Mutual Fund. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Saurabh Pant 
Text: Two questions one just picking up from the last question this increase in import duty that we saw in the budget on footwear from 25 to 35 and on the accessories from 15 to 20 what changes have you seen in the industry and has it benefited players like us who are more backward integrated that is one, the second is in terms of the season I understand that there is hardly any fresh design where the summer season is almost over, so how you are preparing for the winter/fall in terms of bringing new designs or do you think this year we are not going to see any new introductions and what does that mean in terms of spend behind the capex or molds, etc.? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to watch the market condition and the consumer demand, we may introduce smaller number of articles but in current situation we have different challenges to tackle like for example supply chain, understanding the nature of demand etc. we already have good number of designs, and some of them we might introduce. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Saurabh Pant 
Text: During winter/fall you will have new designs? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Yes definitely. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Saurabh Pant 
Text: So, does it reduce the capex intensity Sir this year because half the year has almost gone you would not have had any new designs? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, capex will continue because our one plant is coming up, some expansions are taking place, some machineries are required, so at least INR 100 Crores of expenditure is going to take place this year also. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Saurabh Pant 
Text: Any corresponding increase, in your setup it is tough to give a number in terms of expansion from a volume point of view, but what does it mean from an expansion of production in terms of this percentage increase does it increase the production capacity with this Rs. 100 Crores? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: There is new plant coming up in Bhiwadi whose first civil construction is going on so it may take another one-and-a-half year. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Saurabh Pant 
Text: This is for the Bhiwadi plant all of this 100? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Like some of the machinery here and there or whatever they require, sometime old machinery has to be changed, new moulds have to be ordered somewhere because of some more machineries are required so that is important portion and we have been doing for last so many years, every year some capex has to be there. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Saurabh Pant 
Text: Bhiwadi will be a small part of this 100 Crores right maybe I do not know if you can give a number? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Out of 100 Crores, as construction is going on so 50% will go to civil construction and rest will go to mould and some changes in machinery and other routine expenses. So, the capex this year majorly is on the building part. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Saurabh Pant 
Text: Of this 100 Crores 50% will go to Bhiwadi and rest will go in terms of maintenance? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: And for mould and machinery also. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Saurabh Pant 
Text: Just on the first question if you can throw some light on the duties imposed by the government have you seen any noticeable impact? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: That is not going to play a much effect on us because these are the sports shoes that people import on low price under value whatever they do so that is not an issue our 90% of business is of the other articles. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Saurabh Pant 
Text: Is the competitive advantage meaningful for you that now it has been also imposed on accessories and also on the fully built shoes? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, it does not matter, we have been always among all kind of competition, this duty up and down does not matter.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sabyasachi Mukerji 
Text: Two questions from my side. First on the volume growth you mentioned that for full year there is a volume decline of 2.7% I missed on the Q4 volume decline if you can throw some light on that? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: You can see there is a value degrowth of 15% in this quarter, so volume degrowth is also around 18% to 20% in this quarter because of lockdown and we have been selling premium product so this time value growth is mainly due to premium and product mix. Overall for the year it is -2.7%. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sabyasachi Mukerji 
Text: Yes, overall for the year I understand. So, for Q4 if I can ask what would have been the growth or other than what was the growth till March 15, 2020 first 75 days of the quarter has there been any growth in for 75 days of the quarter? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.977)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: You are talking about this year or March? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sabyasachi Mukerji 
Text: I am talking about Q4 FY2020 if I exclude the last 10, 15 days where we saw the lockdown impacting the sales what is the growth in the remaining period? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We were growing in a double digit growth, we deliver 12% plus growth till December so we were growing in a good way double digit growth was there till mid March and then I think everything got impacted due to COVID, it would have grown double digit to this quarter also had there been no COVID. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sabyasachi Mukerji 
Text: That double digit around 12% value growth you are saying so volume growth would be around 7%, 8%? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We can say definitely there is a gap of 6%- 7% so at least 5%- 6% growth would have been there in volume. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.967)

Speaker: Sabyasachi Mukerji 
Text: Second part much more on the industry we know that almost probably 60%, 65% of the industry is unorganized in nature and given this pandemic situation most of these players would be facing cash crunch liquidity issues do you see this pandemic moving into something like that this organized case will come out much more stronger and there will be a market share shift to some unorganized and organized players in the coming future? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.995)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Let us hope for it. Government is trying to support SMEs like anything so nothing to worry we have a good position in the market, and we will keep on growing the way we have been growing. In the past also, competition activities always remain, and competition activity should be there always then only the whole industry grows, so even in the local, some people will survive but some people may not. Even in local some may invest stronger depending upon every management to management, on how they handle situation

Speaker: Chirag Shah 
Text: Sir my first question is on realization trend so if I look at your realization per pair this year it is up by 8% and historically last three, four years data you shared in the presentation was almost flattish so just wanted to understand first how do you define premium portfolio, what is the realization in premium portfolio, what is the current contribution and this 8% increase is increase in premiumization or existing product have also seen price increases? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: 20% of our business comes from premium articles and we keep on developing this article after understanding the volume need of the consumer so whatever consumer is needing, we are coming up with options; accordingly, we launch our premium articles. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Chirag Shah 
Text: How do you define the premium article? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It will be very subjective for one person the article of Rs.200 maybe premium other may say no Rs.2000 is premium so Hawai slippers in our category we will say Rs.200 is a premium. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Chirag Shah 
Text: Is it fair to understand anything above Rs.200 per pair would be premium product? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, I mean it depends on category to category in sport shoes Rs.200 is nothing it is close to 1000 where we have basic category, but there is articles of Rs.2000 we may call it premium so we have in our own created segments within our own way of understanding the things and accordingly 20% of such articles we have categorized as our premium articles.

Text: The next question is from the line of Rakshit Ranjan from Marcellus Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Rakshit Rajan 
Text: Sir in your opening remarks you mentioned you have taken certain initiatives to come out stronger from this crisis can you elaborate a bit more on what are these initiatives, whether they are manufacturing and product development in distribution and any specifics you can share? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.66)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Even in the past we always keep interaction with our consumers, distributors, our retailers, so by understanding the evolving need of the consumer our product development is taking place and these articles are more successful in the market that gives us a good edge in the market and post lockdown you know what we have seen at the moment where your footwears are much in demand and we are organizing within ourselves, trying to organize the things, improve the things, so maybe by next quarter when things will normalize then our sports shoe and another segment will also come up. So, we are better prepared than competition I should say to make use of the opportunity if it comes up after a stabilization of maybe second or third quarter. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Rakshit Rajan 
Text: The biggest difference that you expect to see in your business vis-à-vis competition is around manufacturing because of different degrees of return to normalcy on the labor front or is it more around the front-end distribution you can elaborate that as well? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: First of all demand has to pick up other things will follow, we have very good capacities, modern plants, so we are in a better position to serve them also and we have our warehouses spread throughout the country, so servicing for us is easier, so we can give better substance for the people. We have a good sales force on the field, so all these things put us in a good advantageous position to serve the market.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Tejas Shah 
Text: Sir the center point of our long-term strategy for last many years has been identifying new geographies and leveraging our cost leadership and branding capabilities to gain market share, now the two geographies which we have been calling out for the last two years is south and west so when you index your brand strength and I know there is you have mentioned in the past it is difficult to comment on market share, but whatever competitors data you track in this market, what will be our market share rough market share gain in the last three four years if we have to give some ballpark figure? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It will be only estimate we can give you, but information of competition is not at all available. There is no authentic source neither there is any neutral agency who can track these things. So from all the known angle / sources we calculate, it is estimate, that we have a market share of 4% to 5%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Chirag Shah 
Text: Just wanted to check as existing product also have price increase or it was just premiumizing it like so this overall improvement in the realization? I just wanted to understand if 8% increase in realization per pair was due to that increase in share of premium portfolio or our existing portfolio, also some bit of price increase, which led to this overall increase? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It should be a mix of both, some price revisions and premium vertical also getting a more share in our scheme of things. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.678)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Yes, it will be same I think full year average and quarter will be same. B P Rajesh: My second question was in the last two months after the quarter end are you seeing a different demand trends in rural versus urban? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Rural is picking up like anything because most part of India in rural was not lockdown so there was a constant demand coming from rural, but in the urban India there is lot of problem coming up for example retailer is hardly opening a shop even after government regulation they are not opening the shop, even if they are opening their opening would be for limited timings so rural India is more promising than the urban India so that is what we can see in next one month time. B P Rajesh: That is very helpful. My last question is you were earlier talking about PU being imported and there is a player, which is in the process of putting up capacities do you think that is good for your industry in the sense that hopefully the cost will come down or if you can give some color on that particular event? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Whether PU or EVA both are imported materials, so material is not an issue. Now we have to make what is the demand if more demand is on PU slippers we will make PU slippers more, for example currently Hawai slippers, Bahamas and Flite, EVAs their demand is more so we have focused more on that, but I think you have to know about the prices of raw material. B P Rajesh: My question is that now that a player is setting up the capacity in India itself are you likely to buy from them or do you think the landed price of importing PU is still going to be cheaper? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.951)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, , domestic also import the material and do the mixing only, , they are also importing so we have to see wherever we get some price advantage we will buy it from them. B P Rajesh: Okay, thank you so much.

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending our earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal 20. We have already shared our earning press release and result presentation, hope you got an opportunity to go through that. I will start with the Q2 FY20 financial performance followed by H1FY20 financial performance. In Q2 FY20, Relaxo booked an operating revenue of 622 cr up by 14.5% Year on Year. This revenue growth was the result of across-the-board performance with our Sparx and Flite, PU, Bahamas categories registering higher growth than other categories. Advantage of price increase took in past helped in the growth of this quarter. This quarter growth is a mix of value and volume growth. Benign raw material prices and increased premiumisation in some categories led to an improvement in the gross margin to 56% as against 53% in same quarter last year. Our employee expenses were 11.6% of revenue and almost similar to that of Q1FY20. The increase in absolute value of employee expenses in Q2FY20 as compared to corresponding period of last year is due to inflationary growth, creation of new position in sales and addition of manpower for our new production capacities. Due to adoption of IND AS 116, our rental expenses have reduced, and simultaneously depreciation and interest expenses have increased. The total impact of this new accounting standard on EBITDA is an increase of 11.8 cr. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 16.8% vs. EBITDA margin of 16.4% in Q1FY20 and 13.5% in Q2FY19. EBITDA margin of 16.8% for Q2FY20 stands at 15% without IND AS 116. Our Company has chosen to exercise the option of lower tax rate of 25.168% as introduced by the Taxation Laws Ordinance 2019. The full impact of this change has been recognized was 71 cr for the quarter, up by 79% YoY with a PAT margin of 11.3%. For First half of FY 2020, we registered a revenue of 1270 cr, up by 15% Gross margin of 55% and EBITDA margin of 16.6%. Favourable raw material prices in FY20 and volume & value mix supported this growth. Our PAT of 120 cr in H1FY20 with a PAT margin of 9.5% grew by 41% YoY. During H1 of FY20, we generated a cash of 160 cr from operation and spent 74 cr in capex and repayment of current and non-current borrowings. At the end of Sep 30th, 2019, we have 370 exclusive brand outlets which contributed 7% to our H1FY20 revenues. We have added net 27 new stores in this period. Exports have expanded to new territories and are contributing 4% of revenues. Going forward, we expect raw material prices to remain favourable. We would continue our efforts to grow our presence in untapped and under-penetrated markets and focus on strengthening our brands. We can now open the floor for questions.

If you can size up the whole quarter for us in terms of demand scenario because we are seeing some of very low-ticket categories also face a lot of problems both at distributor end and also at the consumer end but we reported very strong numbers in this difficult environment. So what is working for us and if you can comment on the demand in general also? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I agree that the market condition is not so good, but you know that the footwear industry is a little different from other industries. If you are able to have good articles & develop new articles, the demand of such articles then really helps the company. This year we have introduced a lot of articles and many articles have been well accepted in the market. As a result, our growth, even among challenging conditions, is quite satisfactory. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: It was similar in Q2 as well? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Q2 was lower but Q1 was better, high value items were more in sale because it was a season period for those shoes which are at a higher price. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: Sir, if I look at past trends, we have been doing some 16% to 17% volume and now because of economic scenarios and consumption slow down, we have moved to 8%. So, on the second half, do you see the same trend to continue or do you see an improvement in your overall volume growth? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: October-November-December, in this quarter, because it is winter time, more of closed shoes are going to sell. So, volume growth will be in the same way it was in Q2. The Q4, when the summer season comes up, then I think the volume growth may be better. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ashish Kanodia 
Text: You talked about price increase earlier & how there was some change in the product mix. Can you throw some light on that? Also, what percent of value growth would be attributable to pricing and mix? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: There was an increase in price in only selected articles and now it is very difficult to calculate what you are asking. It is a mix of both- volume, price increase, premiumization, etc. New products are also coming & they are also part of it, maybe say 20% share our new product is also going into it.

Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Neerav Sawai 
Text: Sir also it could be very helpful if you can just give us a ballpark number in terms of breakup between your premium products or the traditional Hawai products so we can get a sense on what is growing faster & especially driving the growth. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.988)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The way we operate, we introduce the article at different price points and depending upon the demand we serve the market. You cannot say that this is premium or that isn’t premium. There are different price points at which we are serving whether Sparx brand or Flite brand or our Bahamas brand. So in every category, there are certain articles, which are at higher price points and certain at lower points. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Neerav Sawai 
Text: So brands like Sparx and Bahamas are more on the premium side, is it the right way to look at it or is it SKU wise depending upon the article? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Total cash generation was INR 160 Crores and out of this we have spent INR 74 on the capex which we incurred in these six months and INR 205 Crores that is a notional entry due to Ind AS-116.So, we put some assets there that were related to long-term lease and land we shifted from the PPE to this category. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Vaishnavi Mandhania

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: We shifted INR 50 Crores lease out land from the PPE to the ROU assets and then property which were on rent we converted due to Ind AS-116 around INR 158 Crores, so a total of INR 205 Crores has been shown and on the other side we have shown the liability.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Himanshu Nair 
Text: Firstly, if you can give us some color on our regional performance, just so as to understand whether this growth is driven more by higher distribution penetration in markets like South India and West where we are not that strong. If you can just give us some color on the zonal growth that we have seen in the North, East, West, and South? some part of East are now growing at a better rate because these are virgin markets for us. So, there is a lot of empty space in the market. Our Sparx brand and Bahamas are picking up in these markets. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Himanshu Nair 
Text: Okay can you share whether our key market, which is north, has that grown in the first half? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: North has also grown, but you know south and west are also growing at a faster rate because there is lot of empty space in those markets. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Himanshu Nair 
Text: Second question on the industry, Sir. You said around 60% to 70% is unorganized. So, can you share what that number was 2-3 years back? Is there a shift that we are seeing or are all branded players put together taking away share from unorganized guys? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.699)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No not much of a change. Maybe some of the people who we call unorganized are trying to organize themselves after the implementation of GST and demonetization. Few years back it was not more than 30% as organized and 70% as unorganized. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Himanshu Nair 
Text: So that number broadly remains same? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Gradually people will shift to organized, the way things are going, people are getting organized but not at a rapid pace. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Himanshu Nair 
Text: Sir, final question on our EBO, you said we have 370 EBOs as of now, so just wanted to understand that what is the company’s strategy there? Are we looking at a very aggressive expansion in this EBO channel and is it more profitable for the company to sell more through these channels? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are not very aggressive on it. Our purpose establishing all these EBOs is to display and create awareness of our articles. Ultimately, multibranded outlets give us a maximum sale. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: In value terms or volume terms? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jason Soans 
Text: Both, if possible? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It is only an estimation that we can give. Because when I say 70% is unorganized, figures are not revealed at all, so just to guesstimate, we have 5% share in the market. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Jason Soans 
Text: In terms of organized player, as you have 7.5 lakhs pairs of capacity, who could be the second and third largest player, probably Paragon or Campus? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Number of pairs wise, we are the largest and then VK Group is also having good numbers, Paragon is having good numbers, but again they being unlisted Companies, we do not know number wise data. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.989)

Speaker: Jason Soans 
Text: I understand that you have large domination in the Northern and Eastern Indian markets, now in terms of the west and south, where you have a lot of traction for Flite PU as well as Sparx, just wanted to know - for example, like Bata has an exclusive business outlets where they can showcase their whole range of products but while at the same time Relaxo being a value added player/ price point player still does not have any exclusive price points for example in a major market like Bombay. So, what is your strategy towards that? I think that it could really help in terms of creating a lot of brand recall and a brand for our product and in terms of awareness as well, so what is your strategy towards that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: The strategy of setting up of all the retail outlets is basically to explain the entire range of products that we manufacture & to kind of display it so that the people are aware of what we actually make. Multi-brand outlets keep very few articles on their shelf or their display counters, so that was when we realized that how will our consumers know what we are doing, and with that objective in mind, we started opening the outlets as a marketing channel, display cum exhibition. It is a cost neutral model and our objective of it is not as that of a business model like Bata, we have a different consumer.

Text: Thank you for the opportunity. Just wanted to understand that in terms of distribution, we have around 35,000 retailers having touch points at 35,000 points so what would be the split between north/west and what would be south and how are we growing in south, if you can highlight? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Definitely North is the highest because we are situated in north. South and west are now growing, in Sparx and Bahamas brands and other brands are also coming up For articles like our Hawai slippers, there are regional players in that market & so there is stiff competition. Due to article like Sparx where there is no regional player, we got an easy entry into the market. Now other premium article like Bahamas is getting the entry and now Flite PU is also getting an entry there. So, slowly and steadily we are able to tap the market wherever there are empty spaces and in other markets also like Central India. Wherever we find our space and wherever there is any opportunity, we are trying to capture those unutilized markets. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Rajiv Shah 
Text: We will write off the small capex like machinery and other things within the same year or because for the new factory we are spending INR 100 Crores over three years and still our capex is INR 100 Crores for the six months, so probably we will be spending INR 160 Crores-170 Crores, right? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, the total capex is INR 100 Crores & we have given the bifurcation of this, we will spend it in this year FY2020. Sushil batra: INR 100-INR 110 Crores maximum we will be spending this year. 70% of amount is already spent and the rest we will spend in the next half year.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Jugani 
Text: Thank you for giving the opportunity. Sir my question is in terms of the gross margin expansion that we have seen this quarter. So, are we planning to take this gross margin ahead or are we looking for some kind of pricing action so that we can then go ahead and push more volumes because historically also we have been gunning for volumes. Is there a change in strategy or anything that you would like to highlight? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We keep on introducing articles based on the demand or the need of the consumers as per our understanding, at different price points and whatever is needed by the consumer we keep on manufacturing those articles. This year, our premium or better priced articles have been more in demand so accordingly we are making those articles. So, quarter to quarter we keep on understanding evolving needs of the consumer and accordingly we are trying to fulfill those needs of the consumer. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.919)

Speaker: Gaurav Jugani 
Text: Point very well taken. My only point is that do we target a particular gross margin level that we have in mind or there is still scope for expansion going ahead in gross margins is what my question is? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.728)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to be little judicious in these kind of things. We cannot just keep on expanding and there is a lot of competition and then we do not want to leave this space and give it to our competition, so we have to very intelligently improve margins also and still remain competitive in the market. That is the way we are operating now. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Gaurav Jugani 
Text: Sure. Sir, in terms of the distribution expansion, do we set a target every year? Like say that we need to expand our distribution reach by say 10%, 5% or any odd number? Can you share anything with that regards? keep on building, finding distributors and improving our distribution and that is an ongoing process. Even after 10 years, we will find some empty spaces & the same process will continue.

Text: Good afternoon. I am Sushil Batra from Relaxo. I will just start with the Q4 and FY2019 financial performance, which we have already circulated. Highlights of this Q4, revenues increased by 16% to Rs. 636 Crores as compared to last year Rs. 550 Crores. This quarter growth has been mainly driven by increase in volume. EBITDA was at Rs. 95 Crores as against last year Rs. 98 Crores, so corresponding period of the previous year due to higher raw material prices, EBITDA margin in this quarter was 15%. Financial cost stood at Rs. 1.73 Crores. There is a decrease of 29% as compared to last year quarter. PAT was at Rs. 54 Crores as compared to last year quarter Rs. 53 Crores. PAT margin in this quarter was 8.5%. Full year highlights revenue was up by 18% to Rs. 2,292 Crores as compared to last year Rs. 1,949 Crores.

Overall our strong execution delivered a good quarter ended the fiscal on a strong note on growth in revenue mainly driven by volume. During the year, the margins were under pressure due to higher raw material prices; however, the impact was contained as we continued to focus on operational efficiency and streamlining product offering in the market. Way forward the imported raw material prices are softening and expected to continue benign. We will continue to adopt strategic initiative to capture expanding market opportunity in and explore geography and drive growth across all segments of our business. We remain committed to strengthening our brand with continuous innovation and accurately assessing customer preference and price positioning, creating, enduring value for our customer and shareholder is the key objective of the business.

Text: Thank you very much Sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, we will wait for a moment while the question to assemble. We have our question from the line of Ritesh Gupta from Ambit Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to get a sense from the gross margin side so on Y-o- Y basis I can see that your gross margins were still flat. Of course, there is the base effect to it, but so my question is that the gross margin side when can we start seeing an uptick in the gross margins? Secondly, on the other expenditure as well as on the employee cost side, we saw a significant jump of almost about 21% and almost 26% in the quarter. If you would just give us a sense to what drove the increase in the cost from the employee side and the other expenditure side? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Ritesh, gross margin was under pressure majorly due to raw material in this quarter, if you compare it with the last year quarter and the change in product mix was another reason of this change in the gross margin. Regarding employee cost, it is a normal inflation and some positions we created in the system that added to cost but overall it was due to new capacities and additions in the selling department that has increased the cost but it is majorly due to normal inflation. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: And Sir on the other expense side because even on a sequential basis, we saw meaningful jump in other expenses side, so what drove that and is there one-off or something in that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Other expenses majorly include handling and processing charges which is labour cost on contractual basis. Some categories are growing which require more job work and that is also included in ‘other expenses’. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.972)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Sir, probably from a next year point of view in terms of gross margins, what kind of improvement do you see and probably on the EBITDA margin if any guidance which is there? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Guidance generally we cannot reveal much, but as mentioned, raw material prices are expected to soften, so we can hope things should be better. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: On volume growth rate side, do you continue to remain volume focused because you were supposed to take some price hikes to also counter some of the raw material pressures that you have incurred, so is there any thinking in terms of volume growth as well as within the pricing growth side down from the philosophy point of view? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.661)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: This year things will be little better, because raw material prices are softening and last year we had to take some price cuts in certain categories of the footwear because of GST impact. This year, raw material prices are on comfortable side and we have revised prices of certain categories, which will improve the things. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: But will you take some more quarters to kind of start seeing because you will have certain inventories which will be there with you, so would it take of few quarters for the gross margins to start normalizing or would it be like the fourth quarter was probably the end of the pain? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.978)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Every quarter we review things keeping in view the raw material prices, other expenses and market conditions, so quarter-to-quarter we keep on reviewing and you will see in the coming quarter things will only improve. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta

Text: Thank you. We have next question from the line of Sangeeta Tripathi from Edelweiss. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sangeeta Tripathi 
Text: Thanks for taking my question. Congratulation on good set of volumes, 14% volume growth is quite an achievable number, good number. Again, my question is as far as the strategy is concerned, what I understand as this year, this strategy was clearly driving volumes, sales growth came despite increase in the raw material prices, we were like, we chose growth as compared to the maintaining the margins and other things and now we are seeing that raw material prices have started softening, so can you give first and foremost some sense on what kind of softening we have seen and trend on the EVA pricing front that is part one of the question? Second part is, do we continue to still, as Mr. Dua said, that we have also taken certain price cuts also in this particular year despite raw material prices increasing, so are we going to increase prices, what is our outlook on that particular front? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: We have taken certain corrective measures to improve our profitability, so last year because of keeping ourselves competitive in the market, we had to take certain decisions, but now raw material prices are also softening and then at the same time we have taken certain price revision measures also. So, now things will improve. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sangeeta Tripathi 
Text: What would have been the price correction as you said that prices have started softening, so on your Y-o-Y basis what kind of a decline or stability we have seen, if you can give some understanding with respect to the EVA prices? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.992)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Sangeeta we do not see much change in EVA prices. I think last year was also normal, but we are seeing good decrease in PU material that is substantial part of our raw material and regarding EVA, we can see if dollar situation improves, then definitely some advantage will come, as we have seen that last year dollar was abnormally high, so EVA will be directly linked with the dollar and PU prices are decreasing with the base price as well as dollar advantage will come in the system. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Sangeeta Tripathi 
Text: What kind of a decline we have seen in the PU prices, which forms a substantial part of our raw material cost? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.996)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: This is you can say around 6%-8% prices would come down. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Sangeeta Tripathi 
Text: Going forward, are we looking for some amount of price increase because what I believe that in the overall portfolio still the prices would be little higher, definitely some stability is there as you rightly said, but still are we like looking at increasing the prices and one full year, one and half years we have not done any price increase, per se? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Already, we have taken some corrective measures in the last quarter around March end. As a policy, we keep on reviewing on quarter-to-quarter basis and accordingly we take decisions based on how market has behaved, raw material pricing etc. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Text: Thank you. We have a next question from the line of Manasvi Shah from ICICI Prudential AMC. Please go ahead. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manasvi Shah 
Text: Thanks for taking my question. My first question is what is the mix between Sparx, Flite and Hawaii now in terms of value and volumes? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: For Competitive reason we cannot give you exact ratios of these divisions, but all are performing well and growing. We can only tell that Sparx and Flite divisions are growing faster than other divisions. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manasvi Shah 
Text: Sir in your opening comments, you mentioned that the gross margin was also under pressure because of change in product mix, so does that actually it is Hawaii that is done or Relaxo that is done better than the other two? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.991)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have to see business as a whole. In one of the division, we took little competitive pricing that was in Hawaii division, others we have continued with the same. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Manasvi Shah 
Text: You maintained that the other two division Flite and Sparx are actually doing better than Relaxo in terms of overall growth? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Absolutely. They are growing faster. It does not mean that Hawaii division is not doing better. They are doing very good and better than Hawaii. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Manasvi Shah 
Text: So incrementally given that these are higher realization products both Flite and Sparx does mean that gross profits, actually gross margin is headed towards higher level going ahead, I am talking about it from longer term perspective, some 3-5 year perspective? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: When we talked about the Flite, there are two sub categories, one is Flite EVA and another one is the Flite PU. PU we are very aggressive and we took some call in that category that is why we are getting excellent market share. So, margin in this category is little lower than the other category, but that is the fastest growing category. This year material prices will be eased out in this category and it will fall with our company’s overall margin percentage, that is what we are expecting. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.994)

Speaker: Manasvi Shah 
Text: The inventory days have actually risen during the year, any particular reason for this? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.993)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Certain raw material side, it was a conscious call to have more material, because to have an opportunistic buying you have to find certain things available at a better price so some inventory we have taken consciously. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.953)

Speaker: Manasvi Shah 
Text: What is the capex guidance for FY2020 and FY2021? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Sushil Batra 
Text: Capex will be on same line, as we have been doing in the last four-five years, quantum will be around 80 Cr in 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Good afternoon Sir. My question is in terms of penetration level, would you be able to highlight how deeply penetrated we are in India given that we have grown sustainably at 15% at topline level, how should we see our company growing for the next 3-5 years? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: I will just give you a brief. We have Four major brands Flite, Sparx, Bahamas and Hawaii. So, each brand has different market, so we are currently as a company very strong in north and east part of India and for Sparx brand we are doing very well in south and west. So, every year we try to acquire new customers in the new territories, so our efforts are still on for covering the west market for other two brands that is Bahamas and Flite and to spread Sparx in East India also. This is an ongoing process which takes time and we are taking step every year to improve our distribution in these states. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Are we confident, we should be able to continue or sustain, the kind of growth we have seen for the last five years? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Definitely, we are hopeful that India is a huge market and the population size is also huge and we have huge potential to cover unexplored territories. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Have you seen a benefit because of the GST given that the unorganized I believe is almost 70% in footwear, have you seen any kind of shift from unorganized to organized for the last two years? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: Yes, we are seeing the trends happening in the shelves of the retailers in the market. The shift what we can see is that many multiple unorganized brands are getting lower and organized brands are taking more shelf space, this is the only medium we can check that how the industry is moving. Otherwise, everybody is saying that unorganized is going down and organized is going up. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.747)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Last question in terms of our focus is going to be on the retail stores as well and I think I believe we are at around 330-odd stores, so with increasing number of retail stores, obviously our rental expenses will go up and might see some pressure on EBITDA level or the pressure on EBITDA will get offset by the higher ASP product which we sell it through our retail outage? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.864)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The growth in retail is not that aggressive. It is just in line with the way our other businesses are growing, so the ratio of the sale will remain same what it is now. So, it will not have any impact on that because of retail part of it. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: In retail, we are at how much Sir, percentage of the total sales? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: The total business of retail is not that substantial. I do not think it will impact the overall EBITDA of the company. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: If I understand correctly last few years, we have been at around 10% to 12%, retail sales? Sushil Batra : I think it is around 7% and it is slowly increasing, but it is in the same growth range of Company. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: So, 95% is wholesale and 5% is retail right. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, it is not like that. We are exporting, online sales, so far as retail is concerned, retail is around that is what Mr. Batra has told you around 7%. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Akhil Parekh 
Text: Got it Sir. I will get back in queue. Thank you so much.

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: Good afternoon Sir. Thanks for giving me the opportunity. What is your current distribution reach? I mean, how many stores your production is currently available in terms MBOs or the stores currently available in India? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: See what we have done is we have geotagged the relevant outlets, total number of footwear outlets are more than a lakh, but relevant to Relaxo are around 75000 and our availability is on about 45000 to 50000 outlets, the MBOs is what I am talking about. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: How you are planning to increase as your planning to get into more of the territories, company has any structure plan that our retail reach will be growing by 10%-12% per annum? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It depends upon many factors. It depends upon the sales team, advertisement, product portfolio. So, a lot of things are required to increase. What we are saying that in some states in India we are very strong and in some we are weak. So in the weaker markets, the approach is different, and how to enter the market, the strategy is different. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.997)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: FY2019, we have seen revenue growth about 17%-18% and large part of this growth is, volume led growth and now for the last two quarters we have been seeing slow down that is what most of the consumer goods companies have been stated that they are seeing slow down especially in the rural market, so in that context what is your view on the footwear market. Are we seeing some kind of slowdown in footwear segment as well? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We have not noticed this kind of a slow down in rural market, what FMCGs are reporting, there is a slight cash crunch in the market, may be because of election or something like that. Otherwise, we have not noticed this kind of a slow down. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.99)

Speaker: Kaustubh Pawaskar 
Text: So on a sustainable basis, is double-digit kind of volume growth, mid-teens kind of volume growth, can we see mid-teen kind of volume growth for FY2020? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: In value term, we can definitely say the double-digit growth is possible, high volume growth is really tough. So value wise yes we are hopeful that we have grown in past five years, we will maintain that level. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Badjatya 
Text: Thank you for the opportunity. Sir, distribution strategy we have changed from category led to geography led, so what is the rationale behind it and how it has yielded the results in the past two or three years after changing this as strategy? First thing. Second question is that on the plans like as of now in our kitty we have four, five brands like Flite, Hawaii, Sparx and Bahamas so apart from that do we have any bigger brands on which we are concentrating to deliver the high double-digit kind of the growth which we have delivered in the last five to eight years? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.93)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: I think we are pan India Company. We are growing in every geography. We have entered in South with the Sparx brand and that strategy is working well. Otherwise we are pan India and we are present everywhere. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: All brands are growing. As I told earlier Sparx and Flite are growing faster than other brands. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Madhav 
Text: Good evening Sir. This is in continuation with what Gaurav is saying on our current points of sale or distribution reach between in 40000 and 50000 outlets. So over the last five years, if we see our revenue were close to double from 1200 Crores to around 2300 Crores currently, but I think this total point of sale this has been static over the last five years, so it is that whatever growth is coming is only from incremental volumes from the existing touch points or there is any other dynamic or dynamism which is involved here? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.962)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: This was discussed in previous answers also that our online is also growing at a very fast pace, so we are getting lot of growth from online space, modern trade, large formats stores, our own shops and export market. So, we have many levers of growth not only the traditional trade. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Madhav 
Text: So how much should be our online contribution currently? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: It is roughly around 6%-7% of topline. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Madhav 
Text: One more question from my end. I think around five, six years back, we used to engage with an external consultant to help us increase our cost efficiency, supply chain management, which somehow aided in our EBITDA margins growing up significantly, so do we continue to still engage that consultant to increase or more or less most of the efficiencies are done? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: It is need based and if we identify any area which we need to improve or we find we are lagging in our own efforts, we hire professionals to help us out. It depends upon, area to area. 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.788)

Speaker: Madhav 
Text: So Sir you believe there is still scope for our margins to move from the current mid teens level to high teens over medium to longish timeframe? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.822)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We cannot comment on that. We have to keep our products at competitive rates in the market and we have to go for relevant pricing accordingly and we are hopeful that we will sustain the margins, this year will be better than the last year, this we can comment. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aakash Manghani 
Text: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned to one of the earlier questions that growing volumes in double-digit would be really tough. I had a question on this part. If I look at your volume growth over the last five odd years has been 10%-11% CAGR given that the market share that you have on a pan India basis is about 5%-6%. Why do you think it will be really tough to even do double-digit in terms of volume over the next few years? 
Sentiment Classification: negative (Confidence: 0.973)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We are trying in all the markets, but after all double-digit is also quite a good growth, but as far as the value is concerned, definitely we can expect double digits growth. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aakash Manghani 
Text: In your sense or over the last four to five years, what would have been the market growth? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.804)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Market has grown around 10% to 11% and we have grown better than market. Regarding volume growth, definitely last year we adopted different strategy, but now we want to make it a good mixture of volume and value, and product mix with profitability. We are working on many things, so volume is not the only criteria. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aakash Manghani 
Text: Could you comment on the broad profitability across your three brands in terms of pecking order, in terms of range if you could talk, Sparx would be at what gross profit level or Hawaii, or Flite do you have some indication? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: These are all strategic matters. We cannot divulge those finer details in this open medium for competitive reasons. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aakash Manghani 
Text: Lastly, if you were to growth at this double-digit in terms of value terms, say you double your turnover in the five years, are you comfortable that your EBITDA margin should at least inch closer towards 20% rather than be here because there is a significant difference between the gross margin and the EBITDA margin, so all of these overheads should get absorbed at a 4 Crores to 4.5 Crores turnover and read too much better operating profit or you would continue to reinvest in sales distribution, A&P are so and so forth? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: I have to always think of one thing that we have to work on a long-term basis. We cannot be opportunistic in market. Say today, we can make 20% EBITDA margin but we have to keep market relevant prices and always be competitive. We can increase prices what we can sustain so we have to maintain sustainable profitable growth which is our policy. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.57)

Speaker: Aakash Manghani 
Text: You could achieve that without compromising on the gross profit level, I mean saying if your gross margins are around 50%-55% margin, EBITDA margins are 14%-15%. So, if we were to grow at 15% CAGR we have achieved some critical mass now from hereon, these fixed costs should get amortized and profitability should come through as what I was assuming? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: We have no doubt that scale advantage will come in the system. Once we will grow at that sustained high level definitely the cost will be absorbed in the system that is why we are saying, yes it will go in a slow phased manner. We cannot really think about the 20%, as of now. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Aakash Manghani 
Text: On manufacturing today, you manufacture 100% of what are you said, right. There is no outsourcing component? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Around 95% products sold are manufactured in house. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Aakash Manghani 
Text: Going forward also you would want to do that or you could explore that outsourcing component and become slightly asset light, produce at the lower end or I do not know whichever part of the segment you would want to do that, if at all it is feasible? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Generally, we outsource what we cannot produce ourselves or we get a better price for procurement. Otherwise mostly 95% of products are manufactured in-house. We have better control over quality in-house, which is the most important factor for us. Whatever items we do not manufacture at all that we outsource through import and locally also. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.993)

Speaker: Ayush Bagla 
Text: Good afternoon Sir. I just want to ask on your capex and plant, we have seen a rise in the plant and equipment for this year, so is there any particular capex, which has come in and if yes what is that also a reason for dragging the operating expenses up because it would be running at lower utilization as of now. If you would give some color on that? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Well this year, we have added capacity in Hawaii and PU Flite division, so capex expenditure is related to that. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.998)

Speaker: Ayush Bagla 
Text: How would be the utilization of the new plant? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

So, is there any which east is also the big market for you, which region for you is growing fast and any particular region you want to focus on? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.913)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: If you see, the base of south market is small, so it is the fastest growing in terms of the growth rates. We are seeing good growth rate from e-commerce you can say Amazon and Flipkart etc. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhruv Bhatia 
Text: Are all the brands available in the south market or are you still focusing on few brands only in the south? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: All brands are available, but maximum sales is only from Sparx brand. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhruv Bhatia 
Text: In your last year’s annual report, you mentioned about EBO expansion plans and you would also look at the franchisee route to expand, so you could just talk about that, you know what is the plan for the coming year, how many stores you are expecting to open and how many will be through the franchise route? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Last year, we did experiment on franchise. It has worked well. We are getting good response. So we will continue with the same intent and speed, so I think we are getting overall good response in this franchisee route.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, there is no significant change this year and also I do not expect any significant change next year. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Dhruv Bhatia 
Text: Sir, last question as you mentioned that you were expecting the raw material prices to correct and you also mentioned on the other hand that the inventory has gone up because you bought some extra raw material considering that the price would be increasing. So is there some because on one direction you are saying that the prices are expected to correct and on the other you held on to high inventory, does that mean that you are setting at a higher inventory and probably in the near term margins could be under pressure? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: No, we are using many kinds of polymers in the system, so all polymers we have a different buying decision at different times e.g in case of rubber the production in summer goes low, so the prices tend to increase always this time. So, such inventories we always stock in advance. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.993)

Text: Thank you Sir. We have next question from the line of Lakshminarayana Ganti from SBICAP Securities. Please go ahead. Lakshminarayana G: If I look at your ASP for FY2018, I do not have the latest number though around Rs.125, Rs.130 per pair that is probably at the lower end of in terms of your competition when I compare it is probably the lowest. So, how does management think about pricing power with the respect to the Sparx brand as well as Flite and are there any product gaps that the management is looking to introduce and take this up a little higher may be in future, is there a plan to get into leather and so on, so if you could talk about something around ASPs and how you think about that whether the pricing power exists especially in the premium brand? Thanks. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Our all brands are meant for different segments. In Sparx brand ASP is more than Hawaii which is meant for the masses and as far as leather is concerned, we do not have any plan to go for leather manufacturing. We have to focus on these brands only and whatever gap in the market, we find, we introduce those products. Lakshminarayana G: If you talk about what you have introduced by the way of new products in the last one-year that would be useful probably? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: In case of Hawaii segment, Bahamas is the brand which having a premium, Flip-Flops, so lot of articles we have introduced in that segment. The Sparx particularly in the sports shoes, lot of article have come in that category also and in Flite, lot of article in Flite PU category which are better priced than other Flite articles. So, this is the way the market is responding and accordingly we are launching the products, so our policy is to launch customers relevant products. Keep on studying the market and accordingly keep on launching the products. Lakshminarayana G: One last question, in your opening remarks, you mentioned something about Flite EVA versus Flite PU, there being some different dynamics at play. If you could just highlight I missed that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Flite PU is basic kind of semi-formal footwears. EVA is the polymer, which is used to make this footwear and in case of PU, PU is the different polymer, which is used in that category. So on that basis, we call these categories. PU is a kind of semi-formal category and EVA is very casual kind of a full lightweight article which you can use in monsoon also and wash and wear kind of category meant for masses also and for medium scale also. Lakshminarayana G: Was there anything unusual in the last one year between these two? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: So in the current time, the PU categories going faster than the Eva category. Lakshminarayana G: Thank you so much.

Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: Probably, I think you have discussed during the call. I just wanted to check how we are expanding your distribution, so for example, if I see your volume growth rate of 13%-14% probably this year, then how much of it would have come from distribution expansion and how much would be from the existing distribution that will get you about and by distribution, I mean MBO is what I am talking about? 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.661)

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: We have mentioned before also that there are 75000 outlets what we have geotagged but the number is much more and we are holding around 5% share in the footwear industry. So, there is a huge scope of growth in every state, like if you go in West India like Gujarat there are so many districts, every year we are appointing new distributors in the unmanned or unrepresentative areas, we are opening new distributors, so we are getting good growth from there as well, we have e-commerce, retail and exports where growth is good. So Relaxo is now omnichannel present, so growth is coming from all the areas. 
Sentiment Classification: positive (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: From a profitability perspective, is there any difference between any of these channels that one is more profitable than others or all are same?

Speaker: Gaurav Dua 
Text: All are almost same. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: On the raw material side, how many months of inventory, do you keep or is it more opportunistic as you we are discussing earlier probably more in terms of let us say bigger raw materials like EVA or PU for that matter? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)

Speaker: Ramesh Kumar Dua 
Text: Inventory is in all polymers, because PU and EVA are imported so there is a long supply time, so we accordingly have little more inventory. It depends upon the markets requirements also sometime we find some material available at a better price and we store more inventory levels. 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 0.999)

Speaker: Ritesh Gupta 
Text: But purchase to sell how long it could be, is it like two to three months or probably more than that? 
Sentiment Classification: neutral (Confidence: 1.0)
